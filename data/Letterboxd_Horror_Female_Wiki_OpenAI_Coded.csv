Midsommar,2019,Ari Aster,M,Florence Pugh,F,"Several friends travel to Sweden to study as anthropologists a summer festival that is held every ninety years in the remote hometown of one of them. What begins as a dream vacation in a place where the sun never sets, gradually turns into a dark nightmare as the mysterious inhabitants invite them to participate in their disturbing festive activities.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midsommar,"In the middle of winter, an American student, Dani, is traumatized after her mentally ill sister Terri kills their parents and herself via carbon monoxide poisoning. This strains Dani's relationship with her increasingly distant boyfriend, Christian.

Several months later, Christian and his friends Mark and Josh have been invited by their Swedish friend Pelle to attend a nine-day midsummer festival at his ancestral commune, the Hårga, in the rural Hälsingland region of Sweden. The festival occurs only once every 90 years. Josh, who is writing his thesis on European midsummer festivities, regards it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Christian had intended to break up with Dani, who is still grieving the death of her family, but reluctantly invites her after an argument.

At the commune, they meet Simon and Connie, a British couple who were invited by Pelle's commune-brother Ingemar. Ingemar offers the group psychedelic mushrooms. Dani has a bad trip and hallucinates about her dead family. The day after their arrival, the group witnesses an ättestupa ceremony, whereby 2 elders commit suicide by jumping off a cliff onto the rocks below. When one of the elders survives, the commune members mimic his wails of pain before crushing his head with a mallet. The commune elder, Siv, attempts to calm Connie and Simon by explaining that every member does this at the age of 72, which is considered a great honor.

Christian also decides to write his thesis on the Hårga commune, irritating Josh. Dani is disturbed by the ceremonies, but Pelle convinces her to stay. He explains that he, too, was orphaned after his parents perished in a fire, and the commune became his new family. Connie and Simon demand to leave and are individually driven to a nearby train station. During his thesis research, Christian is told that outsiders are sometimes brought into the commune for ""mating"" purposes to avoid incest. He is encouraged to participate but refuses. After unwittingly urinating on a sacred tree, Mark is lured away by one of the female commune members. That night, Josh sneaks out of bed to take illicit photographs of sacred texts. He is caught by a half-naked man wearing Mark's skinned face and is bludgeoned to death.

The following day, Dani and Christian are pressured into drinking a hallucinogenic tea. Dani wins a maypole dancing competition and is crowned May Queen. Christian drinks the hallucinogenic tea and is coerced into a sex ritual to impregnate Maja, a 15-year-old member of the Hårga, while older nude female members watch and mimic Maja's moans. Dani witnesses the ritual and has a panic attack. She is surrounded by the commune's women, who mimic her cries of despair. After the ritual, a naked Christian attempts to flee. He discovers Josh's severed leg planted in a flowerbed and a barely alive Simon on display in a barn, having been made into a blood eagle. An elder blows a powder in his face, paralyzing him.

For the final ceremony, the commune leaders explain that the commune must offer nine human sacrifices to purge it of evil. The first four victims (Mark, Josh, Simon, and Connie) were outsiders lured to them by Pelle and Ingemar, while the next four (the two elderly members who killed themselves in the beginning, plus volunteers Ingemar and Ulf) are from the commune. As the May Queen, Dani must choose either the paralyzed Christian or a randomly selected commune member as the final sacrifice. She chooses Christian, who is stuffed into a disemboweled bear's body and placed in a wooden temple alongside the other sacrifices. As the commune prays, the temple is set alight. As the temple and its human sacrifices burn, the commune members mimic Ulf's screams. Dani sobs but smiles as the temple collapses.","Writing in The Guardian, Steve Rose describes Midsommar as ""a powerful study of grief, betrayal, breakups, and more"". Rose suggests that Dani's three male companions may be seen as representing ""toxic masculinity"", or analogues of the three male companions in The Wizard of Oz (namely the Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow). Rose proposes that the film may be read as a ""parable of snarky, city-smart, modern rationalism undone by primal rural values"". Alternatively, he proposes that the villagers' traditions could be read as far-right, white nationalist or eugenicist.[10]

In Vox, Alissa Wilkinson described Midsommar's story as following Dani's emotional journey and following fairy tale conventions, where Dani loses her family at the beginning and goes on to become a Queen, as with Cinderella and Snow White. The article also notes the use of imagery foreshadowing later events throughout the film.[67] Aster himself said ""We begin as Dani loses a family, and we end as Dani gains one. And so, for better or worse, [the Hårga] are there to provide exactly what she is lacking, and exactly what she needs, in true fairy tale fashion.""[12]

Monica Wolfe discussed Midsommar as reflecting themes of globalization and American imperialism in a 2022 article in the Journal of Popular Film and Television. Wolfe outlines the film's competing ideologies of femininity versus masculinity, academic knowledge versus folk knowledge, and capitalism versus communism, writing that ""the horror of the film is driven by the objectified Other’s resistance to the imperial power’s desire to dominate physical place and own ideological space, but is complicated by a suggestion that, in this unique case, the Other is also a nationalist, right-wing power, and the tension between home and foreign reflects that of a new Cold War.""[68]

The film's central sex scene, between Christian and Maja, has been the subject of debate as to whether it depicts rape. An article in Sexuality & Culture asserts that ""the ambiguous nature of this scene may be viewed as problematic because it blurs the line between consent and sexual assault"" and that the film has implications for contemporary understandings of rape, particularly of males.[69]

Yusuke Narita, a Japanese professor at Yale University, positively cited a scene in the film where an elderly person is forced to jump off a cliff. Narita used this as an example of ""mass suicide"" or ""mass seppuku"", which he claimed was the only way to solve the aging crisis in Japan. The comments resulted in a major controversy but also resulted in Narita becoming a popular figure among some young Japanese people.","### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood**: One could argue the theme of loss and seeking familial connections, akin to motherhood, is present. Dani loses her biological family and ultimately finds a form of family with the commune.
2. **Other**: The film prominently explores themes of grief and trauma, particularly how Dani deals with her emotional journey after significant personal loss and betrayal. This doesn't fit neatly into the categories of motherhood, gender-based violence, female sexuality, or beauty, but touches on deeper psychological and emotional experiences of womanhood.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Other**: Dani doesn't fit neatly into any of the traditional roles listed. She's a grieving young woman struggling to find stability and support, which drives her emotional arc. She is neither a mother nor housewife, an adolescent girl in a coming-of-age story, a professional related to beauty, nor a caretaker in a professional sense.

### Monstrous-Feminine:
1. **Monstrous-feminine**: Dani can be interpreted as the ""monstrous-feminine"" in this context. By the end, she embraces the violent and cultish customs of the commune, choosing to sacrifice Christian, signifying a drastic transformation from victim to a near-monstrous figure empowered by primal, communal values. This aligns with Barbara Creed's idea of the woman as both nurturer and castrator.

### Protagonist's Fate:
1. **Survives**: Dani survives at the end of the film. She gains a new role within the commune, symbolized by her coronation as May Queen.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
1. **Empowerment**: Ultimately, the film suggests female empowerment. While Dani experiences extreme victimization and trauma throughout her journey, she gains agency and autonomy by the end. Her decision to embrace the commune and choose Christian as the final sacrifice indicates her taking control over her life's narrative and finding a new sense of belonging and purpose, despite its horrifying context.

In summary:
- **Themes**: Motherhood (familial loss and reconnection), Other (grief and trauma)
- **Role**: Other (a grieving young woman)
- **Monstrous-Feminine**: Yes
- **Fate**: Survives
- **Focus**: Empowerment",5,5,1,2,2,1
The Menu,2022,Mark Mylod,M,Anya Taylor-Joy,F,"A couple travels to a coastal island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the chef has prepared a lavish menu, with some shocking surprises.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menu_(2022_film),"Foodie Tyler Ledford and his date Margot Mills travel by boat to Hawthorn, an exclusive restaurant on a private island operated by celebrity chef Julian Slowik. The other guests are food critic Lillian Bloom and her editor Ted; wealthy regulars Richard and Anne Leibrandt; washed-up movie star George Diaz[a] and his personal assistant Felicity Lynn; business partners Soren, Dave, and Bryce; and Slowik's alcoholic mother Linda. The group is given an island tour by maître d' Elsa, who notes that Margot is not Tyler's designated guest.

Dinner begins and Slowik introduces a series of courses, during which he delivers increasingly unsettling monologues. For the third course, uncomfortable truths about each guest are exposed via images laser-printed on tortillas. During the fourth course, sous-chef Jeremy kills himself. When Richard tries to leave, the staff cuts off his left ring finger as a warning to stay. Slowik arranges for Hawthorn's angel investor Doug Verrick, to whom Slowik relinquished ownership during the COVID-19 pandemic, to be drowned in front of the guests. The fifth course commences with Slowik allowing himself to be stabbed by Katherine, an employee whom he had sexually harassed. The female guests dine with Katherine while the men are given the chance to escape the island via a game of cat-and-mouse, but Slowik's staff catches them all. When Lillian attempts to gain Katherine's favor by offering assistance in starting her own restaurant, Katherine reveals that she was the one who suggested Slowik kill the guests and staff.

Slowik explains that each guest was invited because they contributed to him losing his passion for his craft or because they make a living by exploiting the work of food artisans like him. He announces that everyone will be dead by the end of the night. Since Margot's presence was unplanned, Slowik privately gives her the choice of dying with the staff or the guests. When she hesitates, he chooses the staff. Margot is unmasked as an escort named Erin, whose clients included Richard, whom she stopped meeting because he hired her to pretend to be his daughter. Slowik reveals that Tyler was informed the guests would be killed. Despite this, he was so zealous to participate in Slowik's craft that he kept it secret and hired Margot to replace his ex-girlfriend because Hawthorn does not seat lone diners. Slowik invites Tyler to cook and his performance fails to live up to his pretensions. Slowik humiliates him by detailing his culinary mistakes, then whispers in his ear, and a deflated Tyler leaves the kitchen.

Slowik asks Margot to go to the smokehouse and retrieve a barrel needed for dessert. As she leaves the kitchen, she discovers that Tyler has hanged himself in a closet. En route, Margot sneaks into Slowik's house, where she is attacked by a jealous Elsa. After a scuffle, Margot fatally stabs her. After seeing a framed employee of the month award showing Slowik as a young and happy cook preparing hamburgers at a greasy spoon diner, Margot finds a radio, calls for help, and returns to the restaurant with the barrel. A Coast Guard officer named Dale arrives. After the guests are convinced they have been saved, Dale reveals himself to be a line cook in disguise and returns to the kitchen.

Margot confronts Slowik for his ""loveless"" cooking and complains that she is still hungry. When he asks what she would like, Margot requests a cheeseburger and French fries prepared without the pretentiousness of fine dining. Slowik personally attends to her meal and finds joy in doing so. After one bite, Margot praises the food, then requests to take it ""to go"". Slowik allows her to leave, and Margot escapes on the Coast Guard boat docked nearby.

The dessert is an elevated s'mores dish in which the staff decorates the restaurant with sauces and crushed graham crackers, then dresses the guests in marshmallow stoles and chocolate hats. Slowik sets the restaurant ablaze, detonating the barrel and killing the guests, staff, and himself. Margot watches the fire from the boat, eats her cheeseburger, and wipes her mouth with a copy of the menu.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Gender-based violence**: The movie tackles the theme of sexual harassment through the character Katherine, who had been sexually harassed by Slowik. Her act of stabbing him signifies both the exposure and retaliation against such violence.
2. **Other**: **Empowerment through autonomy**: Margot exercises agency by challenging Slowik's authority, making demands, and ultimately securing her escape. While this doesn't fall into the specified categories, it is heavily tied to themes of autonomy and survival.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
**Adolescent girl**: Although Margot could be seen as vulnerable and initially out of her element, she evolves throughout the movie to embody resilience and agency.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?
**Other**: Margot/Erin is not portrayed as a monster. Instead, she is a symbol of survival and autonomy, who successfully navigates through the horror without becoming monstrous herself.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?  
**Survives**: Margot escapes the island on a boat, leaving behind the chaos and horror that transpired in the restaurant.

### Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment?
**Empowerment**: Margot's journey is more about empowerment. She starts out as an escort brought in to replace someone else but ends up taking control of her storyline, making key decisions that lead to her survival. The audience can understand her desires and actions, moving the narrative toward female autonomy and agency.

Overall, ""The Menu"" is a gripping tale that explores darker facets of the human psyche while focusing on Margot's empowerment and autonomy.",5,3,2,2,2,1
Black Swan,2010,Darren Aronofsky,M,Natalie Portman,F,A journey through the psyche of a young ballerina whose starring role as the duplicitous swan queen turns out to be a part for which she becomes frighteningly perfect.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film),"Nina Sayers, a young dancer with the company of New York City Ballet, lives with her overprotective mother, Erica, herself being a former ballerina. The company is opening the season with Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. After forcing prima ballerina, Elizabeth ""Beth"" MacIntyre, into retirement, artistic director Thomas Leroy announces he is looking for a new dancer for the dual roles of the innocent and fragile White Swan, Odette, and the sensual and dark Black Swan, Odile. Nina auditions for the roles and gives a flawless dance as Odette, but fails to embody Odile.

The next day, Nina asks Thomas to reconsider but when he forcibly kisses her, she bites him and runs out of his office. Later that day, Nina sees the cast list and learns to her surprise she has received the lead role. At a gala celebrating the new season, an intoxicated Beth accuses Nina of providing sexual favors to Thomas in return for a promotion. The next day, Nina hears Beth had been hit by a car; Thomas believes she was attempting suicide. Nina then visits an unconscious Beth in the hospital and is distraught to see her critically injured legs, meaning that if Beth recovered, she wouldn't be able to be a dancer.

During rehearsals, Thomas tells Nina to observe a newcomer, Lily, who has a physical resemblance to Nina but also an uninhibited quality Nina lacks. Nina has hallucinations and finds scratch marks on her back. One night, despite Erica's objection, Nina accepts Lily's invitation to go out for drinks. Lily offers Nina an ecstasy capsule, saying it would help her relax. Nina turns it down at first but then accepts. She repeats Lily's assurance that the effects will only last for a few hours, and quickly begins to act under the ecstasy's influence. Nina flirts with men at the bar and Lily as well. After the two dance at a nightclub, they go back to Nina's apartment in a taxi, where Lily masturbates Nina. When they arrive at Nina's apartment, Nina yells at Erica to leave her alone. She promptly has sex with Lily. The next morning, she wakes up disoriented and hungover, and realizes that she is late for the dress rehearsal.

Arriving at the Lincoln Center, Nina sees Lily dancing as Odile and confronts her about last night. Confused, Lily denies having sex with Nina, saying she went home with one of the men from the bar. Nina becomes convinced Lily intends to take her place, especially after learning that Thomas has made Lily her alternate. Nina's hallucinations grow stronger and her injuries increase, going as far as hallucinating herself transforming into Odile. On opening night, Nina berates her mother for calling the theatre and telling them she was not well enough to perform, worried that the role might be too much for her. When Nina arrives late, Lily is prepared to replace her, but Nina convinces Thomas to allow her to take back her role.

Towards the end of the ballet's second act, Nina is distracted by another hallucination and loses her stability as Odette. This causes the male dancer playing the prince to drop her on stage, which infuriates Thomas. She returns to her dressing room and finds Lily preparing as Odile. During a confrontation, Lily transforms into Nina. The two fight, breaking a mirror. Nina stabs her doppelgänger with a large shard of glass from the mirror, killing her. The body reverts to Lily. Nina hides the body in the bathroom and takes the stage, dancing flawlessly as Odile and seemingly turns into a black swan, her arms covered in feathers. Amidst a standing ovation from the audience, Nina surprises Thomas with a passionate kiss and returns to her dressing room.

As Nina resumes the Odette tutu and white swan makeup, she hears a knock at her door. She opens it to find Lily, who is alive, apologizing for the misunderstanding and congratulating Nina before taking her leave. She sees the mirror is still broken, and the towel used to mop up the blood is clean with no body in the bathroom. Nina then looks down and pulls a piece of glass from her abdomen, realizing she had stabbed herself instead. She dances the final act of the ballet, which ends with Odette throwing herself off a cliff and her landing on a mattress. Everyone erupts in thunderous applause while Thomas, Lily, and the others gather to congratulate Nina, who remains lying on the mattress. Thomas sees the blood spreading at her waist and shouts for help. He frantically asks Nina what happened to her, to which she calmly replies: ""I felt it. It was perfect,"" as the screen fades to white.",,"**Themes**

1. **Female Sexuality**: The film heavily explores Nina's sexual awakening, particularly evident in her interactions and hallucinations involving Lily. Her journey to embody both the White Swan and the Black Swan roles includes grappling with her own repressed desires and sensuality.
   
2. **Beauty, Perfection, or Aging**: The narrative is deeply entrenched in the pursuit of perfection in the highly demanding world of ballet. Nina's obsession with achieving flawlessness in her performance underscores the extreme pressures of the artistic ideal, connecting beauty and perfection.

**Protagonist's Role**

3. **Professional role related to beauty or perfection**: Nina is a ballerina, a profession that places immense emphasis on physical perfection, beauty, and performance excellence.

**Main Protagonist as a Monster**

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Nina fits into the category of the ""possessed body"" as she increasingly loses her grip on reality, hallucinating and transforming into the figure of the Black Swan. Her behavior also echoes the ""monstrous mother"" archetype, particularly in her fractious relationship with her own overbearing mother and her ultimate violent actions.

**Protagonist's Fate**

1. **Dies**: Nina succumbs to a fatal self-inflicted wound by the end of the movie.

**Victimization vs. Empowerment**

1. **Victimization**: Despite moments of seeming control, Nina spends much of the film under immense psychological pressure from her environment and her own mental state. Her ultimate demise suggests a lack of true empowerment, as her pursuit of perfection and identity reconciliation leads to her tragic end.",4,3,1,1,1,1
The Silence of the Lambs,1991,Jonathan Demme,M,Jodie Foster,F,"Clarice Starling is a top student at the FBI's training academy.  Jack Crawford wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism.  Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film),"Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee, is assigned by her boss, Jack Crawford, to interview the incarcerated Hannibal Lecter, a highly intelligent former psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer. Crawford secretly hopes to gain insights into a psychopathic serial killer known as ""Buffalo Bill"", who kills overweight women and skins them.

Starling meets Lecter in his cell at the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Although initially courteous, Lecter rebuffs her, deducing Crawford's true motive. As she is leaving, another prisoner, Miggs, flings his semen at her, angering Lecter, who changes his mind and provides Starling a clue. The clue leads to a jar holding a man's severed head. The man is linked to Buffalo Bill, and Lecter offers to profile the killer on the condition that he is transferred away from Dr. Frederick Chilton, whom he detests. Meanwhile, Lecter influences Miggs into swallowing his own tongue and committing suicide, presumably to avenge his revolting action toward Starling, and another victim is found, with a death's head moth lodged in her throat.

In Tennessee, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of a U.S. senator. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he helps them capture Buffalo Bill in time to rescue Catherine. Instead, Lecter demands a quid pro quo, offering clues in exchange for personal information about Starling; she agrees. Chilton exposes Starling's deceit and offers Lecter a new deal. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis, where he gives Senator Martin accurate information on Buffalo Bill's appearance but falsely identifies him as ""Louis Friend"".

Starling figures out the name is an anagram of ""iron sulfide"", also known as ""fool's gold"". She visits Lecter, now imprisoned in Tennessee. She describes a traumatic childhood incident wherein she heard lambs screaming at slaughter in the barn but could not save them. Lecter speculates that she hopes saving Catherine will end the recurring nightmares she has from this event. Satisfied, he returns the case files to her. That evening, Lecter brutally kills his two guards and escapes from his cell.

With her notes from Lecter, Starling figures out that Buffalo Bill knew his first victim: Frederika Bimmel. She travels to Bimmel's Ohio hometown and discovers that she and Buffalo Bill were both tailors. In Bimmel's room, she finds evidence that reveals Buffalo Bill is making a suit with human skin. The culprit is a man named Jame Gumb, who believes he is transsexual but was deemed too violent to apply for a sex-change operation. Crawford and an FBI Hostage Rescue Team storm Gumb's address in Illinois but find the house empty. Meanwhile, Starling follows a lead that takes her to the house of Bimmel's former client. There, she meets the real Jame Gumb, realizing he is Buffalo Bill after spotting a death's head moth. She pursues him and finds Catherine trapped in a dry well in the cavernous basement. Gumb stalks Starling with night-vision goggles but reveals himself by cocking his revolver; she reacts quickly and shoots him dead.

At the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is in the Bahamas at a Bimini airport. He assures her that he has no intention of pursuing her and requests that she return the favor, which she says she cannot. He hangs up, stating that he is ""having an old friend for dinner"" as he trails a newly arrived Chilton into the crowd.
","In the years following its release, The Silence of the Lambs was subject to much film criticism regarding its themes of human sexuality and sexual politics.[8] Throughout the film, Clarice Starling's gender is emphasized as a distinguishing feature, as she is a minority amongst her numerous male peers, though film scholar Barry Forshaw notes that ""any feminist agenda is never bluntly formulated verbally"".[9]

Some gay male critics and feminists felt that the film's portrayal of Buffalo Bill negatively associated the LGBT community with deviance, psychopathy, and violence.[10] Despite this, Bill's sexual orientation is never explicitly stated in the film, and Lecter expressly states Bill is ""not really transsexual"".[11] Demme argued that this criticism was misguided, telling The New York Times that ""I got all this unfounded abuse... [Buffalo Bill] wasn't a gay character. He was a tormented man who hated himself and wished he was a woman because that would have made him as far away from himself as he possibly could be."" Demme added that he ""came to realize that there is a tremendous absence of positive gay characters in movies"".[12] Despite that, in following years the film (and its claims that Bill is ""not really transsexual"") has been criticized for transphobia by transfeminists, who claimed that it is ""one of the most significant and impactful examples of pop culture transmisogyny"" and it ""encourages disbelief of trans people’s self-identification"".[13][14][15]

In a 1992 interview with Playboy magazine, the feminist and women's rights advocate Betty Friedan stated: ""I thought it was absolutely outrageous that The Silence of the Lambs won four [sic] Oscars. [...] I'm not saying that the movie shouldn't have been shown. I'm not denying the movie was an artistic triumph, but it was about the evisceration, the skinning alive of women. That is what I find offensive. Not the Playboy centerfold.""[16]

Hereditary,2018,Ari Aster,M,Toni Collette,F,"When Ellen, the matriarch of the Graham family, passes away, her daughter’s family begins to unravel cryptic and increasingly terrifying secrets about their ancestry.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_(film),"Miniature artist Annie Graham lives with her psychiatrist husband Steve and their two children, 16-year-old son Peter and 13-year-old daughter Charlie. The family attends the funeral of Annie's secretive mother, Ellen, at which Annie is surprised at the number of mourners in attendance. She attends a bereavement support group, revealing her troubled childhood and that she and her mother had a fraught relationship until Charlie was born when Ellen became a significant figure in raising her. Meanwhile, Steve receives a phone call telling him that unknown perpetrators desecrated Ellen's gravesite, but does not reveal this to Annie.

Peter is invited to a party, and Annie insists that Charlie accompany him. At the party, Peter leaves Charlie unattended and suggests she eat some of the cake that's being handed out, but neither realizes it contains walnuts. After eating the cake, her severe nut allergy is triggered, sending her into anaphylactic shock. As Peter drives Charlie to the hospital, she leans out of the window for air; when Peter swerves to avoid a dead deer lying in the road, she is accidentally decapitated by a telephone pole. In shock, Peter drives home and leaves Charlie's headless body in the back seat of his parents' car, which Annie discovers, to her horror, the following morning.

The family is fractured following Charlie's funeral: Peter becomes reclusive and wracked with guilt over his sister's death, Annie becomes bitter and resentful toward Peter for his involvement in the accident, and Steve tries to mediate peace between them. Annie befriends a support group member named Joan, who teaches Annie to perform a séance to communicate with Charlie's ghost. Later that night, Annie convinces her family to attempt the séance. Objects begin to move and smash, and Peter is terrified when Annie is possessed and speaks in Charlie's voice until Steve throws water on her. As Peter begins to be haunted by supernatural forces, Annie suspects Charlie's spirit has become vengeful and demonic. When she sees images manifesting in Charlie's sketchbook threatening Peter, she throws the book into the fireplace. However, her clothing goes up in flames at the same time as the book does. Her clothes only stop burning when she pulls the book away from the flames.

Annie goes through her mother's old belongings and finds a photo album that shows Ellen as ""Queen Leigh,"" the leader of a coven, and Joan as one of her acolytes. Another book describes the demon king Paimon, who wishes to inhabit the body of a male host. The summoner of Paimon will receive wealth and rewards. In the attic, Annie finds Ellen's rotting, decapitated body and occultist runes drawn in blood.

While Peter is outside his school, Joan appears and attempts to expel his spirit from his body for the demon king. In class, Peter is taken over by an unseen force and slams his head against his desk, breaking his nose. Annie informs Steve of her ties to Charlie's sketchbook and begs him to burn it, as she cannot bring herself to take her own life. When he refuses, believing Annie has gone insane, she snatches the book from him and flings it into the fire, only for Steve to burst into flames instead. Annie watches in horror, but her expression grows blank as she is taken over by the same force that possessed Peter earlier.

As naked coven members begin gathering both inside and around the house, Peter wakes after dark and finds his father's charred corpse, then quickly notices one of the coven members in a nearby doorway. A now-possessed Annie then chases him through the house. He attempts to hide in the attic; Annie follows him and then beheads herself with a piece of piano wire. Peter jumps from the attic window, dying upon impact with the ground. A glowing orb enters and reanimates his body. Now displaying Charlie's mannerisms, he follows Annie's floating headless corpse into Charlie's treehouse, where Joan and other members of the coven—as well as the headless corpses of Peter's mother and grandmother—are worshipping a mannequin with Charlie's crowned, severed head placed on it. Joan removes the crown and places it on Peter's head, addressing him as Charlie. She then proclaims that Charlie is Paimon, the coven having ""corrected his female body"" and given him his preferred male host. The coven then hails Peter as King Paimon.",,"### Themes related to womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: The story heavily emphasizes the complex relationship between Annie and her mother Ellen. Ellen’s influence over Annie and her children ties directly into themes of generational family trauma and the dark side of motherhood.
2. **Gender-based violence and manipulation**: The movie explores how the coven's manipulation and dark rituals, particularly involving Ellen and later Joan, exert control and violence over the female members of the family.

### Role of the main protagonist
1. **Other**: Annie is a miniature artist, which does not fit neatly into the traditional categories of mothers or housewives, adolescent girls, professionals related to beauty or perfection, or professionals related to caretaking. Her role focuses more on her identity as an artist and a mother dealing with intense grief and trauma.

### Monstrous feminine
1. **Monstrous feminine**: Annie becomes possessed and is driven to behavior that fits the archetype of the ""possessed body"". Her forced beheading and subsequent pursuit of Peter also align with the concept of a ""monstrous mother"".

### Does the female protagonist die or survive at the end?
1. **Dies**: Annie dies when she beheads herself with a piece of piano wire while under demonic possession.

### Story focus: Female victimization or female empowerment?
1. **Victimization**: The narrative largely centers on Annie’s victimization by supernatural forces as well as the malevolent influence of her mother and the coven. Throughout the film, Annie is subjected to escalating emotional and supernatural terror, with little agency over her fate. Ultimately, she cannot overcome these threats and succumbs to them.",1,1,1,1,1,1

Her father is infirm and paralyzed, and her strict mother, Ruth, insists that she help care for both him and the farm as they isolate themselves to protect against the Spanish flu pandemic. Pearl aspires to be a chorus girl or a film star, which Ruth disapproves of, and chafes under the isolation. Pearl also shows signs of psychopathy. She abuses her father in secret and kills animals, which she feeds to an alligator she nicknamed Theda.

One day while visiting town, Pearl meets a projectionist who takes a liking to her. After returning to the farm, Pearl continues to show signs of mental disturbance as she dances with a scarecrow in a cornfield and masturbates with it. During supper, Ruth berates Pearl for her behavior and withholds her food.

Pearl hears from Mitsy, her wealthy sister-in-law, of an audition to find new dancers for a troupe around the state, and envisions it as her ticket out of spending her life living on the farm and having to care for her father. She later visits the projectionist, who shows her the illicit stag film A Free Ride and encourages her to pursue her dreams. Pearl comments that she cannot abandon her family and she says, ""If only they would just die.""

That night, Ruth and Pearl get into an argument over dinner as she reveals that she knows about Pearl visiting the movies. Pearl confesses she wants to audition and asks for Ruth's permission, to which she declares Pearl as her biggest failure. An altercation erupts during which Pearl shoves her mother against the hearth, causing her dress to catch fire. As she burns, Pearl pours boiling water onto her to douse the flames and then drags her into the basement while leaving her father alone in the room. She then flees to the theater, where she has sex with the projectionist.

The following morning, the projectionist drives Pearl home to prepare for the audition. However, he is disturbed by her sudden agitated behavior, as well as the sight of a rotting pig that her mother-in-law left for Ruth the day before. As he tries to leave, Pearl erupts into a fit of rage at the perceived abandonment and stabs him to death with a pitchfork. She pushes his car into a pond, where Theda eats his remains. Pearl dresses herself in one of Ruth's Belle Époque gowns and dresses up her father before smothering him to death using a pillow cover.

Pearl arrives at the church to attend the audition. She thinks her dance performance will impress the talent scouts, but is rejected for not being young, blonde, or ""all-American"". Mitsy accompanies her home in an attempt to console her, which results in Pearl launching into a lengthy confession regarding many things, from resentment toward her husband and having an affair to killing animals, her parents and the projectionist. Pearl then coerces a stunned Mitsy into confessing that she won the audition, although she did not. As Mitsy tries to leave, Pearl chases her down the driveway and kills her with an axe.

Pearl dismembers Mitsy's body and feeds the remains to Theda, then goes into the basement and lies next to Ruth's corpse. She decides to atone for her crimes by creating a home for Howard.

Some time later, Howard returns and is greeted with the long-decomposed bodies of Pearl's parents seated at the dining table around the rotting feast. As Howard stares in horror, Pearl greets him with a protracted, pained smile, saying, ""I'm so happy you're home.""",,"**Movie Title: Pearl**

**Two Themes Related to Womanhood:**

1. **Female Sexuality**: Pearl's desire to become a chorus girl or film star points to her exploration of her own sexuality and aspirations, which also reflects her rebellious nature against the confines of her traditional role on the farm. Her sexual encounter with the projectionist and her actions with the scarecrow also highlight her sexual awakening and the psychological disturbances tied to it.
2. **Beauty, Perfection, or Aging**: Pearl's obsession with being perfect for the audition and her eventual breakdown after being rejected for not fitting the ""all-American"" ideal shows her struggle with societal beauty standards and the harsh reality of aging or not meeting conventional expectations of beauty.

**Role that the Main Protagonist Plays:**

Pearl does not fit neatly into the traditional female roles of mother/housewife, adolescent girl, or caretaker. Instead, her role is more complex and could be categorized as:

- **Other**: Pearl aspires to be a performer (chorus girl or film star), which ties her role to the artistic and entertainment industry. This aspiration symbolizes a quest for identity and recognition, highlighting her struggle against domestic confinement.

**Is the Main Protagonist Mainly a Victim/Survivor?**

- **Monstruous Feminine**: Pearl embodies the ""Monstruous Feminine"" archetype as she exhibits signs of being a ""monstrous womb"" and a ""castrator."" Her violent actions, psychopathic tendencies, and ultimate transformation into a murderer reinforce this perspective. She is not merely a victim; she is an active agent of horror and monstrosity.

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?**

- **Survives**: Pearl survives at the end of the movie. Her husband returns to find her alive amidst the horror she has created.

**Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?**

- **Victimization**: The story leans more toward female victimization. Despite Pearl taking control through violent means, the narrative centers around her psychological breakdown and failure to escape her circumstances. The audience witnesses her descent into madness and her inability to gain true agency or autonomy, making the story more about her immediate survival and psychological turmoil rather than empowerment.",4,3,1,1,2,1
Us,2019,Jordan Peele,M,Lupita Nyong'o,F,"Husband and wife Gabe and Adelaide Wilson take their kids to their beach house expecting to unplug and unwind with friends. But as night descends, their serenity turns to tension and chaos when some shocking visitors arrive uninvited.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_(2019_film),"In 1986, Adelaide Thomas wanders away from her parents at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and enters a funhouse, where she encounters Red, a doppelgänger of herself, in the house of mirrors. Following the encounter, she suddenly stops speaking and withdraws from her family.

33 years later, Adelaide reluctantly goes on vacation with her husband, Gabe Wilson, and children, Zora and Jason. They meet their friends Josh and Kitty Tyler and their twin daughters Becca and Lindsey at the beach. On the way there, they witness paramedics taking away the bloody body of a man holding a sign identical to one Adelaide saw on the day of the doppelgänger encounter. Jason later sees someone strangely similar to the man, standing still with his arms outstretched and hands bloodstained.

That night, Adelaide relays her story to Gabe when the lights suddenly go out. Jason notices a family of four in the driveway, who break into the house and corner the Wilsons. The intruders are Red and the Wilsons' doppelgängers: Pluto, Jason's pyromaniac, facially scarred double; Umbrae, Zora's sadistic double; and Abraham, Gabe's animalistic double. Red is the only double who can speak, albeit in a guttural, raspy voice. She explains that they are called ""the Tethered,” as they share a soul with their counterparts, and have come to ""untether"" themselves. The Wilsons are separated and terrorized by their doppelgängers. Jason discovers that Pluto mirrors his actions. After Gabe kills Abraham, the family escapes.

Meanwhile, the Tyler family is attacked and murdered in their home by their doppelgängers. The Wilsons arrive and are attacked as well, but they manage to overpower and kill the Tylers' doubles. They turn on the news and learn that the Tethered have been murdering their equivalents across the city and subsequently joining hands to form a massive human chain similar to the one from the Hands Across America demonstration, surrounding the city to prevent anyone from entering or leaving. The Wilsons decide to drive along the coast and escape to Mexico. While they are leaving, Umbrae intercepts the car but Zora kills her.

Arriving at the boardwalk, the Wilsons find many townspeople slaughtered. The road is blocked by a burning car. Jason, realizing it is a trap set by Pluto, orders everyone out of the car. Before Pluto can ignite the family's car, Jason walks backwards, causing Pluto to do the same and thus walk directly into the fire. While the Wilsons are distracted by Pluto burning to death, Red appears and snatches Jason away. Adelaide chases Red to the funhouse where they first met and finds a secret entrance that leads to an underground facility overrun by white rabbits, where she finds Red in a classroom.

Red explains that the Tethered are duplicates created presumably by humans to control the populace (it's unclear who created them, and how).[5] When the experiment failed, the Tethered were abandoned underground for countless years, mindlessly mimicking the actions of their counterparts and surviving on raw rabbit meat. After the other doppelgängers realized Red was ""different"" when she snapped them out of their lethargy, she spent years organizing them to escape and take vengeance by murdering their counterparts. Red and Adelaide begin to fight, but Red evades and counters all of Adelaide's attacks. When Adelaide allows Red to attack, she impales Red with a fireplace poker, and then strangles her to death; breaking her neck in the process. She rescues Jason from a locker, and Jason also rescues one of the rabbits.

As she escapes in an ambulance with her family, Adelaide reflects back to the night she first met Red. She recalls that she herself is the Tethered doppelgänger and that Red is the original Adelaide, the doppelgänger having choked Adelaide unconscious (damaging her larynx, resulting in her hoarse voice), dragging and trapping her underground, and returning to the surface to usurp her life. Jason looks at his mother, who simply smiles.

Meanwhile, the Tethered form a human chain stretching out of Santa Cruz to nearby cities, as helicopters fly overhead.","Critic Jim Vejvoda related the Tethered to ""urban legends"" and ""xenophobic paranoia about the Other"", also writing they resembled the Morlocks in H. G. Wells's 1895 novel, The Time Machine.[44] Journalist Noel Ransome viewed the film as being about ""the effects of classism and marginalization"", writing ""the Tethered are effigies of this same situational classism. They're trapped—mentally and physically—and ignored"".[45] Joel Meares of Rotten Tomatoes also noted that the Tethered, referencing the ""we're Americans"" line, are representatives of the duality of American society, how some citizens can afford to live on top of the class system while others are stuck in poverty. He also noted the title Us could mean ""U.S."", or United States.[46]

Manohla Dargis of The New York Times notes that the Wilsons are ""introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery"" similar to the opening of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, and sees that movie as the principal influence on Us. Describing Peele as a ""true cinephile"", she also identifies allusions to other films, including Jaws, A Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Goonies, as well as one scene suggesting an influence by the Austrian film director Michael Haneke's 1997 horror film Funny Games and subsequent U.S. remake.[47]

The Tethered's red jump suits and single glove were an allusion to Michael Jackson along with the ""Thriller"" shirt seen on young Adelaide, and Peele has stated that Jackson was ""the patron saint of duality"".[46][48] Peele referenced many other instances of 1980s culture, including allusions to The Lost Boys and Hands Across America, stating ""Everything in this movie was deliberate, that is one thing I can guarantee you. Unless you didn't like something and that was a complete accident"".[48][49]

The film contains numerous references to Jeremiah 11:11, which reads: ""Therefore thus saith the Lord: 'I will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape. Although they cry out to me, I will not listen to them'"" (NIV). Critic Rosie Fletcher commented on the context, with Jeremiah warning Jerusalem was facing destruction due to false idols, and expressed the opinion that the film's characters also ""worshiped the wrong things"", such as Ophelia, the virtual assistant.[50]

Peele later explained in the film's digital release special features that a central theme of the film is American privilege:[51]

""One of the central themes in Us is that we can do a good job collectively of ignoring the ramifications of privilege. I think it's the idea that what we feel like we deserve comes, you know, at the expense of someone else's freedom or joy. You know, the biggest disservice we can do as a faction with a collective privilege like the United States is to presume that we deserve it, and that it isn't luck that has us born where we're born. For us to have our privilege, someone suffers. That's where the Tethered connection, I think, resonates the most, is that those who suffer and those who prosper are two sides of the same coin. You can never forget that. We need to fight for the less fortunate.""

— Jordan Peele[51]","### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Other**: The film ""Us"" largely addresses the effects of classism, marginalization, and American privilege. It doesn't directly focus on motherhood, gender-based violence, female sexuality, or beauty/perfection/aging. Instead, the theme revolves around the societal divide and duality within America, as encapsulated by the concept of the Tethered and their upper-world counterparts.
2. **Other** (Identity and Duality): The film explores themes of identity, particularly through Adelaide and her doppelgänger. This theme of duality can be extended to consider how women's identities can be fragmented and contested.

### Main Protagonist's Role
**1) Mother or Housewife**: Adelaide is depicted primarily as a mother and wife. Her role involves nurturing and protecting her children and maintaining family unity.

### Main Protagonist as a Monster
**1) Monstrous Feminine (Monstrous Womb, Witch)**: Using Barbara Creed's framework, Adelaide/Red can be seen as fitting the ""monstrous womb"" or ""witch"" category. The revelation that Adelaide is actually the doppelgänger ""Red"" challenges the traditional view of motherhood and femininity, casting her in a monstrous light.

### Female Protagonist's Fate
**2) Survives**: By the end of the movie, Adelaide survives the ordeal, but with a dark twist revealing her true identity.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
**1) Victimization**: While Adelaide demonstrates agency in fighting to protect her family, the narrative primarily revolves around her immediate survival against relentless threats. The story delves into deeper themes of victimization and societal marginalization, aligning more with female victimization than empowerment.",5,1,1,1,2,2
X,2022,Ti West,M,Mia Goth,F,"In 1979, a group of young filmmakers set out to make an adult film in rural Texas, but when their reclusive, elderly hosts catch them in the act, the cast find themselves fighting for their lives.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_(2022_film),"In 1979, police officers arrive on a lonely farm in rural Texas and find numerous dead bodies wrapped in bags. They then enter the farmhouse and find something shocking in the basement.

Twenty-four hours earlier, aspiring adult film star Maxine is on a trip to shoot a pornographic film with her producer boyfriend Wayne, fellow burlesque dancer Bobby-Lynne, Marine Corps veteran Jackson, director RJ, and RJ's quiet girlfriend Lorraine. The group arrives at a farm owned by Howard and Pearl, an elderly couple who have a guesthouse they rented for the shoot. Howard disapproves of the group, but Wayne excuses this due to not informing Howard of their intentions.

While Bobby-Lynne and Jackson act out a scene, Pearl invites Maxine into the farmhouse and expresses an unusual fixation on her, as Maxine looks exactly like Pearl when she was young. Howard returns home and Pearl rushes Maxine out, urging her to keep it a secret.

Maxine returns to the guesthouse and shoots a sex scene with Jackson in the barn, as Pearl secretly watches and imagines herself in Maxine's spot. Later, Pearl attempts to seduce Howard but he turns her down, citing heart problems. That night, Lorraine asks to participate in the shoot, upsetting RJ. When everyone is asleep, an angry RJ attempts to drive away and strand the group at the farm, but finds Pearl in the driveway. After he rebuffs her advances, Pearl stabs him to death.

Noticing RJ is missing, Lorraine and Wayne look for him. In the barn, Wayne steps on a large nail and is killed by Pearl with a pitchfork. Meanwhile, Howard invites Lorraine into their house, claiming Pearl has gone missing. He asks Lorraine to retrieve a flashlight from the basement. When she goes down, Howard locks the door and she discovers a naked male corpse hanging from the ceiling.

Howard goes to the guesthouse and asks Jackson to help find Pearl. When they split up to scout the lake's perimeter, Jackson finds a car submerged in the water. After failing to draw Jackson into the water with his flashlight, Howard confronts him and shoots him in the chest. Meanwhile, Pearl sneaks into the guesthouse, undresses, and climbs into bed with Maxine, caressing her body, who awakens in horror to find Pearl lying next to her, waking Bobby-Lynne.

Back in the house, Lorraine breaks through the basement door with a hatchet but Howard breaks her fingers. Bobby-Lynne finds Pearl standing on the lake's edge and tries to help her. Pearl insults Bobby-Lynne and pushes her into the water where an alligator kills her. Pearl and Howard reunite and enter the guesthouse where they have sex. Maxine escapes to the van and arms herself with a pistol. She frees Lorraine, who runs out the front door, only to be shot by Howard. As the couple moves her body inside the house, Lorraine's corpse twitches, startling Howard and causing him to have a fatal heart attack.

Maxine retrieves the keys to Howard's truck and attempts to shoot Pearl, but the pistol is not loaded. Pearl shoots at Maxine with Howard's gun, but the recoil knocks her back onto the porch, breaking her hip. As Maxine gets into Howard's truck, Pearl berates and insults her. Maxine reverses the truck, crushing Pearl's head before driving away. It is revealed that Maxine is the daughter of a televangelist frequently heard throughout the film. The police discover RJ's camera, with the sheriff speculating that it contains footage of ""one goddamn fucked up horror picture.""","Nate Roscoe of Fangoria wrote in an essay on the film that X exemplifies a modern take on the psycho-biddy horror subgenre, in which aging or elderly women portray grotesque, violent characters. Roscoe also notes that the film's primary theme revolves around aging, youth, and longing over the past.[12] ""Snatching its inspo from the shadiest recesses of art and exploitation, it is the relationship between beauty, aging and self-worth that creeps most conspicuously through the architecture of X.""[12] He also notes that the film presents its antagonist—the murderous Pearl—in a manner that is sympathetic, writing that, at moments, ""one can't help but feel crushingly sorry for this tragic figure.""[12]

Critics noted the influence of several films on X, with multiple commentators observing homages to the 1974 film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.[13][14][15] Other films cited by critics as having an influence on X include Psycho (1960), Easy Rider (1969), Hardcore (1979), The Shining, Alligator (both 1980),[14] and Boogie Nights (1997). Richard Roeper wrote that X also contains ""echoes"" of such pornographic films as Blue Movie (1969) and Debbie Does Dallas (1978).[13]","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Beauty, Perfection, or Aging**: The film focuses heavily on the theme of aging, particularly as it contrasts the youthful aspirations and attractiveness of Maxine with the aging and longing Pearl. This is evident from Pearl's fixation on Maxine and her nostalgia for her younger self.
   
2. **Female Sexuality**: The movie delves into female sexuality, showcasing Maxine as an aspiring adult film star. Additionally, it addresses Pearl's unfulfilled sexual desires and her attempts to reclaim her sexuality despite her aging.

### Role of Main Protagonist:

1. **Professional Role related to Beauty or Perfection**: Maxine is an aspiring adult film star, which places her in a professional role that involves elements of beauty and physical appeal.

### Victim/Survivor:

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Pearl fits the ""monstrous feminine"" archetype as described by Barbara Creed. She embodies elements of a ""monstrous mother"" with her violent tendencies and fixation on youth and beauty, perhaps indicating fears associated with aging and lost sexuality.

### Protagonist's Fate:

1. **Survives**: Maxine survives at the end of the film. She overcomes the threats posed by Pearl and Howard, ultimately escaping the farm.
   
### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:

1. **Empowerment**: The story leans more towards empowerment for Maxine. She overcomes significant dangers and threats to her life, gains the agency to defend herself, and ultimately survives. Despite the immediate horrors she faces, Maxine takes control of her situation and escapes, suggesting a narrative of empowerment rather than mere victimization.",4,3,1,2,2,1
A Quiet Place,2018,John Krasinski,M,Emily Blunt,F,A family is forced to live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place,"Sightless aliens with sharp hearing and impenetrable armor plating have taken over the planet and killed most of the human population. The Abbott family – mother Evelyn, father Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau – live on their isolated farm in the middle of a forest in upstate New York, and have survived by taking precautions such as laying sand paths to avoid stepping on crunching leaves and using American Sign Language when communicating.

When the family goes into the nearby town for supplies, Beau finds a toy space shuttle, but Lee makes him leave it behind due to the noise it would make if powered on. As they are getting ready to leave, Regan secretly gives him back the toy, but without its batteries. When they leave, Beau takes back the batteries without anyone noticing. While walking back home, Beau turns on the space shuttle, which starts making noise. Almost immediately, Beau is killed by a nearby creature before Lee can reach him. Regan suffers terrible guilt thereafter, which she hides from her parents, although Marcus is aware of it.

Over a year after Beau's death, the family has seemingly gone back to normal, with Evelyn several months pregnant. Marcus reluctantly goes fishing with Lee while Regan, upset that she cannot go, visits Beau's grave. While the rest of the family is gone, Evelyn goes into labor. While heading to the basement, she accidentally steps on an upright nail and drops a photo frame, alerting a nearby creature which enters the house. Struggling to stay silent amidst the pain, Evelyn flips a switch in the basement, turning the surrounding lights around the house red. The creature enters the basement soon after, but Evelyn distracts it with the loud clicks of an egg timer and escapes upstairs. Upon returning to the farm and seeing the red lights, Marcus and Lee lure the creature out of the house by lighting off fireworks, allowing Evelyn to safely give birth to her baby.

Regan, seeing the fireworks, runs back to the house. Lee enters the house armed with a shotgun[4] and finds the baby and Evelyn, then brings them into a hiding spot under the floor in the barn outside. The baby cries, alerting a creature into the barn. The creature fails to find the source, but breaks some water pipes. Evelyn wakes up in the flooded hideout with the creature still inside and hides behind the falling water to mask her and the baby's sound.

Marcus and Regan climb to the top of a corn silo and light a signal fire to other distant farms, but Marcus falls into the silo and almost becomes sucked into the corn. Hearing this, the creature which is hunting for Evelyn runs towards the silo and attacks Regan and Marcus. The creature's disruptive effect on electronics causes Regan's cochlear implant to emit a high-pitched noise, which causes the creature to reel in pain and retreat, breaking a hole in the silo which frees the children. Lee finds Regan and Marcus, directing them to his truck,[5] and is wounded when a creature attacks him. Marcus cannot stifle a scream, and the monster attacks the truck. Lee signs to Regan that he has always loved her and proceeds to yell to draw the creature's attention, sacrificing himself to the creature in order to allow Marcus and Regan to coast the truck back to the house safely.

Reuniting with a grieving Evelyn and hearing the sounds of a nearby creature, they make their way back into the house and enter the basement, into which the creature follows them. Regan, remembering the reaction the creature had to the high-pitched noise from her implant, places the implant on a microphone which amplifies the noise. The creature screeches in pain and exposes the vulnerable tissue beneath the armor plating on its head, allowing Evelyn to kill it with Lee's shotgun. Armed with a new weapon, the family prepares to defend themselves from an approaching group of creatures that heard the shot.
","Parenthood
Krasinski identified the primary theme of the film as a dramatization of ""fears associated with modern parenthood"".[92] Krasinski, who had recently become a father, said in a conference interview that he ""was already in a state of terror about whether or not [he] was a good enough father"", and added that the meaning of parenthood had been elevated for him by imagining being a father in a nightmare world, struggling to simply keep his children alive.[93] Krasinski has told CBS News that ""the scares were secondary to how powerful this could be as an allegory or metaphor for parenthood. For me, this is all about parenthood.""

Travers' Rolling Stone review argued that ""the question Krasinski tackles is what defines a family and what's needed to preserve it? 'Who are we', asks Mom, 'if we can't protect our children?' The answers are worked out with satisfying complexity and genuine feeling, proving indeed that home is where family is.""[67] The Hollywood Reporter's John DeFore described the film as ""a terrifying thriller with a surprisingly warm heart"" and said, ""you might have to go back to Jeff Nichols' 2011 Take Shelter to find a film that has used the fantastic this well to convey the combination of fear and responsibility a good parent feels"".[94]

Other themes
Speaking of the political and social commentary the film encouraged, Krasinski said, ""That's not what I was going for, but the best compliment you can get on any movie is that it starts a conversation. The fact that people are leaving and talking about anything is really fun—but certainly about deep stuff like that, is awesome.""[92] Krasinski, who did not grow up with horror films, said that prior films of the genre such as Don't Breathe (2016) and Get Out (2017) that had societal commentary were part of his research. In addition to considering his film a metaphor for parenthood, he compared the premise to US politics in 2018, ""I think in our political situation, that's what's going on now: You can close your eyes and stick your head in the sand, or you can try to participate in whatever's going on."" He cited Jaws (1975) as an influence, with how the protagonist police officer moved from New York to an island to avoid frightening situations, and was forced to encounter one in his new location with shark attacks.[95]

Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Barron was surprised by what he saw as strikingly religious themes in the film. He likened the family's primitive, agrarian life of silence to monasticism, and commends their self-giving love. Barron suggested pro-life themes, especially in the choices of the parents, as Mrs. Abbott risks everything to give birth to a child, and her husband lays down his own life so that the children can live: what Barron sees as the ultimate expression of parental love.[96] Sonny Bunch of The Washington Post also commented and expanded on a pro-life message.[97]

Richard Brody, writing for The New Yorker, criticized A Quiet Place for what he perceived to be the inclusion of conservative and pro-gun themes in the film. He described it as ""the antithesis of 'Get Out'"" and ""both apparently unconscious and conspicuously regressive"" and opined that it ""[brings] to the fore the idealistic elements of gun culture while dramatizing the tragic implications that inevitably shadow that idealism.""[98] Krasinski addressed Brody's criticism in a subsequent interview with Esquire, stating that he did not write the film with an intentional political message. Krasinski said, ""I never saw it that way or ever thought of it until it was presented to me in that way. [The film] wasn't about being, you know, silent and political... my whole metaphor was solely about parenthood.""[99]","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Motherhood**: The movie heavily delves into themes of motherhood, particularly through Evelyn, who is pregnant and gives birth under extreme circumstances. The storyline emphasizes the fears, responsibilities, and sacrifices associated with being a mother in a perilous world.
2. **Other (Parenthood)**: While not strictly about womanhood, the film explores the broader theme of parenthood. The struggles of protecting one's children and the emotional guilt and responsibility felt by the parents and children are central to the plot.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

1. **Mother or Housewife**: Evelyn primarily fulfills the role of a mother. Her actions throughout the movie are guided by her instinct to protect her children and ensure their survival.
  
### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?

1. **Other**: Evelyn is not portrayed as a monster in the story. She is primarily a mother striving to protect her family from external monstrous threats.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?

1. **Survives**: Evelyn survives at the end of the movie.

### Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?

1. **Empowerment**: The movie leans towards female empowerment, especially towards the end. Evelyn shows great strength and resourcefulness in protecting her newborn and other children, and she ultimately plays a key role in discovering a method to incapacitate the creatures. Regan also gains agency by using her cochlear implant to fend off the creature, thus actively contributing to their survival.

""A Quiet Place"" ultimately portrays its female protagonists as empowered individuals who, despite facing immense physical and psychological threats, manage to assert control over their circumstances and protect their family.",1,1,2,2,2,1
The Witch,2015,Robert Eggers,M,Anya Taylor-Joy,F,"In 1630s New England, William and Katherine lead a devout Christian life with five children, homesteading on the edge of an impassable wilderness, exiled from their settlement when William defies the local church. When their newborn son vanishes and crops mysteriously fail, the family turns on one another.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_(2015_film),"In 1630s New England, English settler William and his family—wife Katherine, teenage daughter Thomasin, preteen son Caleb, young fraternal twins Mercy and Jonas, and unborn baby Samuel—are banished from a Puritan settlement over a religious dispute. They build a farm near a large, secluded forest, and Katherine bears her fifth child, Samuel. While under Thomasin's care, Samuel abruptly disappears. It is soon revealed that a witch has stolen and killed Samuel to use his body to make a flying ointment.[12][13]

Devastated by the loss, Katherine spends her days crying and praying. William takes Caleb hunting in the woods, where Caleb wonders if the unbaptized Samuel went to Heaven. In response, William discloses that he secretly traded Katherine's prized silver cup for hunting supplies. At the farm, the twins play with the family's billy goat, Black Phillip, who the children say talks to them. Katherine blames Thomasin for misplacing her silver cup and holds her responsible for the loss of Samuel. That night, the children overhear their parents arguing about their possible starvation, and making plans to send Thomasin away to serve another family.

The next morning, Thomasin and Caleb sneak into the forest to check a trap. Their dog Fowler chases a hare, with Caleb in pursuit; the hare frightens their horse, which throws Thomasin to the ground and knocks her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost and discovers Fowler's disemboweled body. Delving further into the thicket, he discovers a hovel from which the witch, disguised as a seductive young woman, emerges and kisses him. Thomasin awakes and finds her way home by following William's voice. As Katherine berates Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods, William defends Thomasin by reluctantly admitting that he sold the cup.

That night, Caleb returns to the farm naked, delirious, and mysteriously ill. Katherine suggests that Caleb has fallen victim to witchcraft and prays for him. The next day, Caleb goes into violent convulsions and vomits a whole apple, before passionately proclaiming his love for Christ and dying peacefully. The twins accuse Thomasin of practicing witchcraft, but she in turn accuses the two of them for their supposed conversations with Black Phillip. Angered by his children's behavior, William locks them in the goat house.

In the middle of the night, the twins and Thomasin awake to find the witch drinking the blood of a nanny goat. In the house, Katherine has a hallucinatory vision in which Caleb and Samuel have returned. In her dream, she takes Samuel and nurses him, but in reality, a raven is pecking at her breast. At dawn, William finds the goat stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing, and an unconscious Thomasin with bloodied hands. As she stirs, William attacks her, but Black Phillip gores and kills him. An unhinged Katherine blames Thomasin for everything that has happened and tries to strangle her. In self-defense, Thomasin tearfully kills her mother with a billhook.

Now alone, Thomasin enters the goat house and urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat responds in a human voice and materializes into a handsome, black-clad man. He asks Thomasin if she wants to ""live deliciously,"" and tells her to remove her clothes and sign her name in a book, promising her the life she has always wanted. Thomasin, accompanied by Black Phillip as a goat, then enters the forest nude, where she finds a coven holding a Witches' Sabbath around a bonfire. The witches begin to levitate, and Thomasin joins them, laughing as she ascends above the trees.","According to analysts, the film's impact is delivered not through scares, but by the effect of ambience and scenography.[25][26] This is stylistically represented by the film's use of expressionist lighting, the use of different kinds of camera to draw thematic limits, the editing employed to hide horror from the main sight, and the soundtrack's sonic dissonance accompanying instrumental scenes.[27] Samuel's physically impossible disappearance at the beginning of the film introduces the viewer to the film's atmosphere.[25]


Linda maestra by Francisco de Goya, 1799
The film's plot orbits around a psychological conflict, using a repressive, patriarchal portrayal of Puritan society and the dark, murderous liberation of the witches.[28] The main female character, Thomasin, harbors worldly desires that differ from those of her conventionally Christian family,[29] yearning for independence,[28][30] sexuality,[31] acceptance,[32][31] and power.[32][31] While her father and the Christian God fail to fulfill her needs, Satan speaks personally to her, offering earthly satisfaction.[33] Therefore, with the demise of her family and the rejection of the Puritan society, Thomasin joins Satan and the witches, her only alternative, in order to find her long desired control over her own life.[34] Her nudity in the last scene reflects her act of casting off the bonds of her previous society.[30]

The difference between both options, nevertheless, is rendered blurred by an evocation of equal religious extremism.[35][31] This is first felt in the architecture of the family's own home, which ironically resembles an archetypal witch's cottage itself, hinting at the gradual reveal that evil is already installed in them.[30] On the opposite side, Satan's temptation of Thomasin also acquires traits of ideological grooming, slowly alienating her from her family.[32][36] At the end, despite her newfound cause and ecstatic laugh at the coven, Thomasin has not escaped her previous religiosity, but merely changed its direction, turning to murder in exchange for freedom.[30][37]

The symbolic conflict between civilization and nature is also present in all the aspects of the film.[38] The family lives next to a dark forest, a place tied to witchcraft in their culture, which underlines the conflict between their civilized, patriarchal religion and the Gothic, wild natural world that surrounds them.[39] The forest, as well as the state of nudity,[30] are associated with monstrosity, with the untamed wilderness where forbidden liberation and sexuality emerge.[28][38][40] Accordingly, Caleb returns nude after being seduced by the witch, the witches themselves perform their acts while naked, and Thomasin eventually adopts this code upon joining them.[30] At the end of the film, nature triumphs over its adversary, with the Pan-like Black Phillip goring the axe-wielding William in a metaphor for man being consumed by the wild.","**Themes Related to Womanhood:**

1. **Female Sexuality**: Thomasin's desires for independence, acceptance, and power align with themes of emerging female sexuality. Her transformation and ultimate choice to join the witches reflect her exploration and embracing of her own desires, which differ from her conservative, patriarchal upbringing.
2. **Other (Patriarchal Repression and Liberation)**: The overarching theme involves a young woman breaking free from the repressive, patriarchal society she was born into. This includes not only her yearning for independence but also her ultimate act of finding power and control by aligning with the witches, a move symbolically tied to liberation from societal constraints.

**Role of Main Protagonist:**

1. **Adolescent Girl**: Thomasin is a teenage daughter, an adolescent girl, who undergoes significant transformation throughout the narrative. Her journey is deeply tied to her transition from girlhood to womanhood within a complex and oppressive environment.

**Portrayed as a Monster:**

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Thomasin embodies elements of the monstrous-feminine by the end of the film. She aligns with the archetype of the witch, a figure historically depicted as the monstrous-feminine. Her final acceptance of Black Phillip’s offer and joining the coven, as well as her participation in the Witches' Sabbath, cast her in the role of a witch, a classic representation of the monstrous-feminine.

**Fate of the Female Protagonist:**

1. **Survives**: Thomasin survives the events of the film. In fact, she appears to thrive by the end as she finds empowerment and liberation with the witches.

**Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:**

1. **Empowerment**: The story ultimately aligns more with female empowerment. Thomasin's journey is about overcoming the oppressive environment she is born into, gaining autonomy, and embracing her own desires. By the end, she takes control of her destiny, even if it means aligning with malevolent forces, suggesting a complex form of empowerment within the narrative.",3,2,1,2,2,1
Barbarian,2022,Zach Cregger,M,Georgina Campbell,F,"In town for a job interview, a young woman arrives at her Airbnb late at night only to find that it has been mistakenly double-booked and a strange man is already staying there. Against her better judgement, she decides to stay the night anyway, but soon discovers that there is much more to be afraid of in the house than the other house guest.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian_(2022_film),"Tess Marshall arrives at a rental house on the evening before a job interview. However, she finds it has been double-booked and is already occupied by a man named Keith. Initially unnerved by Keith, Tess warms up to him and decides to stay the night while Keith sleeps on the couch. When she wakes up in the middle of the night, she is shaken to find her bedroom door has been opened, but Keith is asleep and assures her he did not open the door.

Tess goes for her interview the next morning and is cautioned to stay on guard while in the neighbourhood around the house, which is suffering from heavy urban decay. Returning to the house, she is chased inside by a homeless man who yells at her to leave. She accidentally locks herself in the basement and stumbles across a hidden corridor, leading to a room with a camera, a stained mattress, a bucket, and a bloody handprint.

Keith returns to the house and frees Tess from the basement. Ignoring Tess' warning, he investigates the hidden corridor. When he does not return, Tess follows him and finds a subterranean tunnel attached to the hidden corridor, where she finds Keith injured. While they argue about where to go, the pair are attacked by a naked, deformed woman known as Mother who kills Keith by violently bashing his skull against a wall.

The house's owner, actor AJ, is fired from a television series over allegations that he raped his co-star. Pressured to sell assets to pay his legal costs, AJ travels to Detroit to inspect the house before selling it. AJ finds the hidden tunnel and tries to measure it, believing it may increase the house's value. The Mother attacks AJ in the tunnel, and he falls into a hole where he meets Tess.

A flashback to the 1980s shows Frank, the house's original owner, abducting women, raping them, and keeping them captive in the tunnels, where it is implied that he rapes the offspring.

In the present, the Mother locks Tess and AJ in a hole. Tess tells AJ that the Mother wants them to act as her children. AJ is dragged away by the Mother, who forcibly tries to breastfeed him. Tess uses the opportunity to escape the house with the help of the homeless man from earlier, who warns her that the Mother will come after her at nightfall.

With the Mother distracted by Tess's escape, AJ finds a room which the Mother refuses to approach. Inside, he finds a bedridden Frank and assumes him to be another victim of the Mother. AJ assures Frank that he will call the police, before finding evidence of Frank's crimes. A horrified AJ berates Frank for his crimes before Frank kills himself with a concealed revolver.

Tess leads police to the house, but they dismiss her story and leave as night falls. Tess breaks into the house, retrieves her car keys, and rams the Mother with her car, seemingly killing her. Tess returns to the basement to rescue AJ. AJ, assuming her approaching footsteps are the Mother's, mistakenly shoots her with Frank's gun. The two escape and find that the Mother has vanished. Tess and AJ then take shelter with the homeless man.

The homeless man explains that the Mother is a product of Frank's multi-generational incest with his victims. The Mother bursts in, kills the homeless man by ripping his arm off and beating him to death with it and chases Tess and AJ up a water tower. AJ loses his gun and pushes Tess off the water tower to save himself. The Mother jumps after her and shields her from the fall. AJ finds Tess is still alive, but as he tries to rationalize his actions to Tess, the Mother awakens and gouges his eyes out before splitting his head open. The Mother attempts to comfort Tess, but she remorsefully shoots the Mother dead with Frank's gun and limps away as the sun rises.","Barbarian has been characterized as having themes related to sexual abuse and trauma, and, owing to the book by which Cregger was inspired, themes of different forms of misogyny. Writing for Film School Rejects, Aurora Amidon asserted that the film is essentially about ""the ripple effects of abuse"", concerning the characters of AJ and Frank—who, in the habit of harming women for their own pleasure, are cut from the same cloth.","### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Gender-based violence (such as sexual or physical assault or abuse)**:
   - The movie deals heavily with themes of rape, sexual abuse, and trauma, particularly in relation to the characters of AJ and Frank who harm women for their own pleasure.
   
2. **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth)**:
   - The character of the Mother symbolizes a grotesque and nightmarish manifestation of motherhood, particularly through the lens of Frank’s abuse and the multi-generational incest.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

Talk to Me,2022,Michael Philippou,M,Sophie Wilde,F,"When a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_to_Me_(2022_film),"At a house party in Adelaide, Cole searches for his brother Duckett. When he finds Duckett and attempts to bring him home, Duckett stabs Cole and kills himself.

Sometime later, 17-year-old Mia is struggling with the second anniversary of her mother Rhea's death by an accidental sleeping pill overdose and her distant relationship with her father, Max. Mia, her best friend Jade, and Jade's little brother Riley sneak out to a gathering hosted by Hayley and Joss, where the main attraction is a severed and embalmed hand. Holding the hand and saying ""Talk to me"" enables someone to communicate with a deceased person's spirit, while saying ""I let you in"" allows the spirit to possess them. To prevent spirits from binding themselves to that person, someone else must end the possession before 90 seconds by pulling away the embalmed hand and blowing out a candle to cut the connection. Mia volunteers to go first and is possessed by a spirit that displays a menacing focus on Riley. Joss and Hayley struggle to break the connection, and the time limit is slightly exceeded.

Ecstatic over the experience, Mia joins Hayley, Joss, and Jade's boyfriend Daniel, at Jade's house the next night. Everyone except Riley and his friend James takes several turns being possessed, invoking different spirits each time. Jade refuses to let Riley participate, but all of the others indulge. When Jade leaves the room, Riley insists, and Mia lets him take a turn for 50 seconds. Riley appears to be possessed by the spirit of Rhea, who attempts to reconcile with Mia. Stunned, Mia stops the group from ending the possession in time to keep talking to her mother. The spirits overtake Riley's body, and they make him violently attempt suicide; he is hospitalized in critical condition.

Mia, now haunted by visions of Rhea, is blamed for Riley's injuries and shunned by Jade and her mother, Sue. Having secretly taken the embalmed hand, Mia offers Daniel to stay at her father's house for the night. Whilst platonically sharing a bed with Daniel, she witnesses a spirit appear and suck on Daniel's feet. When he wakes up, he instead sees Mia sucking his feet in a trance and leaves. Mia uses the hand to contact Rhea, who insists that her death was accidental and that she needs to help Riley, who is still possessed and attempts suicide every time he returns to consciousness. Mia leaves the connection open and begins seeing her mother without the hand, losing her grasp on reality.

The friends track down Cole, who explains that a living body naturally expels invading spirits. Mia, fearing that Riley may not have time, attempts to contact him in the hospital by using the hand but is instead shown a vision of Riley being tortured by spirits in limbo. At home, Max reveals that Rhea's death was not an accident and reads her suicide note to Mia, apologizing for hiding the truth from her. Rhea's spirit tells Mia that Max is lying, and Mia hallucinates that she is being violently attacked by Max, causing her to stab the real Max inadvertently. Rhea tells Mia that Riley needs to die in order to be set free from his possession. Mia kidnaps Riley from the hospital, and Jade sees Mia pushing Riley in a wheelchair toward the highway. Rhea attempts to convince Mia to push Riley into oncoming traffic, but instead, Mia jumps into the oncoming traffic and dies.

Mia finds herself in the hospital, where she sees a fully recovered Riley talking to Jade and Sue while Max leaves in an elevator. Nobody responds to her; she has no reflection in the mirror, and her hands are disfigured. After becoming engulfed in darkness, she sees a hand extended over a candle in the distance. She grabs it and is suddenly summoned to a house party in Greece, where a partygoer holding her hand is urged to speak and tells Mia, ""I let you in"".",,"**For the movie ""Talk to Me"":**

1. **Two themes related to womanhood:**
    - **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth):** The relationship between Mia and her deceased mother Rhea is central to the plot. Mia’s unresolved grief over her mother's death and the discovery of the suicide note deeply impact her actions and mental state.
    - **Other:** The trauma and impact of parental relationships are significant themes. Mia grapples with her mother’s death and her deteriorating relationship with her father, which reinforces the influences of parental figures on her mental health and decisions.

2. **Role of the main protagonist:**
    - **Adolescent girl:** Mia is a 17-year-old girl navigating complex emotions related to her mother's death, strained familial relationships, and the supernatural events surrounding the haunted hand.

3. **Main protagonist portrayed as a monster:**
    - **Monstrous feminine (possessed body):** Mia becomes increasingly haunted and influenced by the spirits she contacts, culminating in her own possession and transformation beyond death, ultimately embodying aspects of the ""monstrous feminine"" as she appears to others as a lingering spirit.

4. **Does the female protagonist die or survive at the end?**
    - **Dies:** Mia sacrifices herself by jumping into oncoming traffic, leading to her death.

5. **Ultimately, does the story focus on female victimization or female empowerment?**
    - **Victimization:** Mia is largely a victim of her circumstances, including the loss of her mother, the influence of malevolent spirits, and her deteriorating mental state. She is driven to the brink of insanity and ultimately to her death, indicating a lack of agency and control over her situation. The movie is more about her struggle and ultimate failure to overcome these overwhelming psychological and supernatural threats.",5,2,1,1,1,2
Bodies Bodies Bodies,2022,Halina Reijn,F,Maria Bakalova,F,"When a group of 20-somethings gets stuck at a remote mansion during a hurricane, a party game gone very, very wrong ends with a dead body on the ground and fake friends at every turn as they try to find the killer among them.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodies_Bodies_Bodies,"Bee, a working-class young woman from Eastern Europe, travels with her wealthy girlfriend Sophie to a ""hurricane party"" at a mansion owned by the family of David, Sophie's friend. Other guests include David's aspiring actress girlfriend Emma, the podcaster Alice, her much-older new boyfriend Greg and the enigmatic Jordan. Max, another guest, left after a fight with David the night before Sophie and Bee arrived.

After drinking, using drugs and dancing, the group decides to play ""Bodies Bodies Bodies"", a murder in the dark-style game. Greg goes to bed early due to hostility throughout the game from David, who also leaves soon after another fight with Emma. As the storm worsens, the power goes out and the girls scramble to find a power source. Minutes later, Bee finds David outside with his throat slashed, a blood-stained kukri nearby. Panicked and without reception, the group try to go for help in Sophie's car but find its battery dead due to Bee's error of leaving a light on.

The group discovers Greg has a go bag with a knife and a map of the area and become suspicious of him. They fearfully confront Greg who returns their hostility, at first believing it's a part of the game. After a struggle, Bee bludgeons him to death with a kettle bell out of fear.

The group doubt that Greg was the killer and Emma theorizes that Max, who had confessed feelings for her the night before, returned to kill David. Sophie, a sober addict, relapses and verbally attacks Emma. After she apologizes, Emma kisses her, to Sophie's confusion, before accepting drugs. Alice later finds Emma dead from a head wound at the bottom of the stairs, and believes the group is being killed one by one. Jordan and Alice cast suspicion on Bee, revealing that no one with her name is on record as having graduated from her college; they cast Bee out into the hurricane.

Returning to Sophie's car, Bee finds underwear that matches Jordan's bra in the backseat. She sees Jordan holding David's father's gun through a window, then crawls back inside through a pet door. Bee confronts the group, revealing that she dropped out of college to take care of her mother, who has borderline personality disorder. A vicious verbal fight ensues between the group. It is revealed that Jordan was the ""killer"" in the Bodies Bodies Bodies game, and she reveals resentment for Sophie due to her drug addiction and using David to regain access to her trust fund. She claims Sophie cheated on Bee with her, which Sophie denies. Sophie expresses why she would not date Jordan, that she avoids her friends because their behavior challenges her sobriety and reveals that Jordan only ""hate-listens"" to Alice's podcast. After Alice responds by insulting Jordan's insecurities, Jordan shoots Alice in the leg. A struggle for the gun follows; Alice is fatally shot in the throat. As Sophie and Jordan fight, Bee pushes Jordan over the staircase banister. With her dying breath, Jordan tells Bee to check Sophie's text messages and shoots in their direction multiple times. Bee hides from Sophie out of distrust.

When morning comes and the storm has blown over, Sophie tearfully confesses to Bee that she relapsed and witnessed Emma tripping and falling down the stairs to her death. However, Bee holds her at gunpoint, demanding to see her texts. Sophie tosses her phone away and they struggle, inadvertently picking up David's phone in the process, which shows that David accidentally slashed his own throat while trying to use the kukri to open a champagne bottle for a TikTok video—revealing there was no real murderer after all. As Bee and Sophie realize the bloodshed was all for nothing, a confused Max returns to the mansion, and the power comes back on. When Max asks what happened, Bee only says that she now has service on her phone.","Bodies Bodies Bodies has been described as a ""satire on class and privilege, all mediated by new technology, the language of progressive politics and youth culture, and Gen Z identity itself"".[14] In a piece for The New York Times, Kalia Richardson writes that the film satirizes Gen-Z's symbiotic relationship with their cellphones and the internet, using dark humor to illustrate what happens when those two things became inaccessible: ""when the Wi-Fi goes out, it's like they lose oxygen"", remarks director Halina Reijn .[15] Richardson notes that despite ""the physical danger each character faces, their virtual realities remain central to the plot"", recalling the characters' inability to relate to each other in person without the use of the ""trauma-centered"" jargon of social media such as ""gaslight"", ""trigger"", and ""toxic"".[15]

Several critics noted the influence of Agatha Christie or specifically her 1939 mystery novel And Then There Were None on the film.[16][17][18] In an interview with Vice, director Halina Reijn cited the many films that influenced Bodies Bodies Bodies, such as Heathers (1988), Don's Plum (2001), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), The Piano Teacher (2001), Cries and Whispers (1972), and the filmography of John Cassavetes.","### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Other:** The themes in ""Bodies Bodies Bodies"" are primarily focused on satirizing class and privilege among Gen Z, mediated by technology and progressive politics. Although the characters are predominantly women, the themes do not specifically relate to motherhood, gender-based violence, female sexuality, or beauty, perfection, and aging.
   
2. **Female Empowerment:** Despite the themes focusing on Gen Z social dynamics and satire on privilege, a secondary theme could be considered as female empowerment. This is reflected in Bee's eventual survival and her taking control in a highly chaotic situation by confronting Sophie.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

1. **Other:** Bee's role as a working-class young woman does not fit neatly into the categories traditionally associated with femininity. She is neither a mother/housewife nor an adolescent girl. She does not hold a professional role related to beauty or perfection, nor is she in a caretaking profession. Her role is more accurately described as a resilient survivor who deals with various challenges head-on and takes care of her mother with borderline personality disorder.

### Monstrous Feminine

1. **Other:** Bee is not portrayed as a monster in the story. She does not embody any of the aspects of the ""monstrous feminine"" outlined by Barbara Creed, such as archaic mother, monstrous womb, vampire, witch, possessed body, monstrous mother, or castrator.

### Protagonist's Fate

1. **Survives:** Bee survives until the end of the movie.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment

1. **Empowerment:** The story leans more towards female empowerment. Bee's character is multi-dimensional with authentic needs and desires. Throughout the movie, she navigates threats with empathy and takes action to uncover the truth. Ultimately, she gains agency by surviving the ordeal and confronting the chaotic events.

In summary, ""Bodies Bodies Bodies"" primarily deals with themes of class, privilege, and the complexities of Gen Z's relationship with technology rather than traditional themes directly related to womanhood. Bee's role is that of a resilient and assertive protagonist who ultimately survives and gains empowerment through her actions.",5,5,2,2,2,1

But 1960s London is not what it seems, and time seems to be falling apart with shady consequences.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Night_in_Soho,"Eloise ""Ellie"" Turner, a sweet and naive teenager with troubled mental health, loves the music and fashion of the Swinging Sixties and dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Her mother, also a fashion designer, killed herself in her childhood, so Ellie was raised by her maternal grandmother. She occasionally sees her mother's ghost in mirrors, something her grandmother is aware of.

Ellie moves from her rural home near Redruth, Cornwall to London to study at the London College of Fashion, where she has trouble fitting in with her peers, especially her bullying roommate Jocasta. Only John, another student, is kind to her. Unhappy in the dormitory, she moves into a bedsit owned by the elderly Ms. Collins.

That night, Ellie has a vivid dream where she is transported back to the 1960s. At the Café de Paris, she observes a confident young blonde woman, Sandie, inquire about becoming a singer at the club. Sandie begins a relationship with the charming Mod manager, Jack. The next morning, Ellie designs a dress inspired by Sandie and discovers a love bite on her neck.

Ellie has another dream in which Sandie auditions at a Soho nightclub, arranged by Jack, before returning to the same bedsit that Ellie has rented. Inspired by these visions, Ellie dyes her hair blonde, changes her fashion style to match Sandie's, and gets a job at a pub. She is observed by a silver-haired man who recognises her similarities to Sandie. In further dreams, Ellie discovers Sandie is not living the life she had hoped for, now being pimped by Jack to his male business associates.

In her waking life, Ellie is disturbed by increasingly menacing apparitions that resemble Jack and the men who exploited and used Sandie. After she has a vision of Jack murdering Sandie, she decides to track down the silver-haired man, who she believes is Jack. She goes to the police but is not taken seriously, though the kindly female detective expresses concerns for her wellbeing. She tries to find newspaper reports about Sandie's murder. Instead, she finds stories of local men who vanished without a trace. Believing she must avenge Sandie, Ellie confronts the silver-haired man. He denies killing Sandie and leaves the pub but is struck by a taxi and killed. Ellie's boss reveals that the man's name was Lindsey, not Jack. Ellie recalls encountering him in her dreams; he was an undercover vice officer who tried to encourage Sandie to escape her life of prostitution.

Panicked, Ellie goes to inform Ms. Collins that she is leaving London. Ms. Collins tells her she knows she went to the police because the ""nice police lady"" came to check up on her. She then reveals that she is Sandie. Ellie's vision of Sandie's death was actually a vision of Sandie killing Jack when he threatened her with a knife. Sandie then lured the men she was pimped to back to her room and killed them, hiding their bodies in the house's floorboards and walls. Ms. Collins has drugged Ellie's tea with the intention of killing her to ensure her silence.

In the ensuing scuffle, Ellie knocks over an ashtray and starts a fire. John comes to Ellie's aid, but Ms. Collins stabs him and continues after Ellie, who hallucinates Ms. Collins as the younger Sandie, and that they are ascending a glass staircase. Ellie kicks Ms. Collins, sending her down the stairs. She flees to her room, where the spirits of Sandie's victims plead with her to avenge them, but she refuses. Ms. Collins enters Ellie's room, where she also sees the spirits and is struck by ""Jack"". With the police outside, she attempts suicide but Ellie stops her, understanding why she did what she did. Sandie tells Ellie to save John and herself, remaining in the building as it burns.

But despite their best efforts, all roads lead back to their terrifying pasts and to a final stand that will determine whether their love can survive their otherness.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_and_All,"In 1988, teenager Maren Yearly eats a classmate's finger after sneaking out to attend a sleepover. Her father Frank, used to her cannibalistic nature since she murdered her babysitter at three years old, promptly relocates them. He abandons her shortly after her eighteenth birthday, leaving behind some money, her birth certificate, and a tape recorder. In a message to his daughter, Frank confides his anguish over Maren's apparent lack of remorse following her incidents over the years and voices his hope that she will someday learn to overcome her urges. Hoping that her mother Janelle, who abandoned her when she was an infant, might provide her with answers, Maren sets out to her birthplace of Minnesota.

At a bus stop, Maren is approached by the eccentric Sully, who introduces himself as a fellow ""eater"" and teaches her that their kind can identify one another via scent. He leads her into the house of a dying, elderly woman, insisting to a horrified Maren that her hunger will only grow with time. The woman dies the next morning and Maren reluctantly joins Sully in feeding off the corpse, after which he shows her a braided rope he fashioned from the hair of his victims. Unsettled by Sully's obvious interest in taking her under his wing, Maren flees the house.

While shoplifting supplies in Indiana, Maren defends a woman from being harassed by a drunk customer and is helped by a young man named Lee, who lures the customer outside. She later runs into Lee after he's just finished eating the man, and he takes her along after stealing his victim's truck. Lee offers to accompany Maren to Minnesota, and the two embark on a cross-country road trip, becoming romantically involved. During a brief stop at Lee's hometown in Kentucky, they meet with his sister Kayla, who is unaware of her brother's true nature. Maren is intrigued by Lee's refusal to discuss his father's disappearance and his insistence that he not be spotted around town.

At one point, they come across another pair of eaters, and are both disturbed when one of them describes eating a victim ""bones and all"". After Maren expresses hunger at a local carnival, Lee seduces and kills a male employee while she watches, and the pair feeds off his flesh together. However, upon driving to the man's address, Maren is deeply upset to learn that he had a wife and children, leading to an argument with Lee, who insists that they cannot blame themselves for their nature.

Maren tracks down Janelle's adoptive mother in Minnesota, who informs her that Janelle had willingly committed herself to a psychiatric hospital several years prior. Upon a visit to her mother, Maren is shocked to discover that Janelle has eaten her own hands. A nurse hands Maren a letter from Janelle addressed to her daughter in case they were to ever meet again, in which she proclaims that they are better off dead than living as monsters. Janelle then tries to attack Maren before being restrained. Maren angrily declares to Lee that she refuses to follow her mother's footsteps, and departs while he's asleep. She is soon approached by Sully, who reveals he has been following her, but she again rejects his advances, causing him to become violent. A devastated Lee phones Kayla to tell her that he will be returning home.

Maren eventually finds her way back to Kentucky. She runs into Kayla, who reveals that her alcoholic father had beaten both of his children on the night he went missing and that Lee, initially held as the prime suspect, was cleared of involvement when it was proven that the blood found on him was his own. Maren and Lee rekindle their relationship and decide to resume their travels with no destination in mind. He tells her that he knew his father was an eater when he bit Lee during their scuffle, and tearfully confesses to eating him, as well as to having enjoyed the thrill of it. He asks her if she believes him to be a bad person, but Maren simply declares her love for him. They vow to turn away from cannibalism and lead a normal life together.

After some time, the couple is shown to be happily settled in Michigan, until Maren comes home one day to find that Sully has broken into their apartment. He holds her at knifepoint until Lee arrives, and they manage to kill Sully, though Lee is fatally wounded in the process, and Maren finds a lock of Kayla's hair in Sully's rope. As he lies dying in Maren's arms, Lee pleads for her to love him and eat him ""bones and all"", to which she reluctantly complies.",,"#### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood**: Maren's struggle with her cannibalistic urges is deeply linked to her mother's legacy. Her mother, Janelle, also had similar urges and deemed the situation so dire that she self-institutionalized and eventually tried to attack Maren. This theme of inherited monstrousness suggests a dark twist on motherhood and familial bonds.
2. **Female Sexuality**: The coming-of-age aspect is prominent in Maren's journey. She is a teenager experiencing not only her biological urges but also her cannibalistic ones. Her budding romantic relationship with Lee intertwines with their cannibalism, exploring the darker aspects of intimacy and desire.

#### Role of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Adolescent Girl**: Maren, as an eighteen-year-old navigating her cannibalistic nature and her relationship with her mother, fits this category. She is in a critical transition phase from childhood to adulthood, dealing with profound and horrific aspects of her identity.

#### Monstruous Feminine:
1. **Monstruous Feminine**: Maren's character fits the archetype of the monstrous feminine. She embodies the concept of the ""monstrous womb,"" given her cannibalistic urges that seem tied to her biological and familial lineage. The monstrous qualities are linked to her identity as a woman, making her both a perpetrator and victim of her own nature.

#### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?
1. **Survives**: Maren survives the events at the end of the movie, although her partner, Lee, does not.

#### Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:
1. **Victimization**: The story leans more towards female victimization. Maren is subjected to continuous physical and psychological threats, from her biological urges to external predators like Sully. While she gains some agency by seeking out her mother and rejecting Sully's advances, she remains a victim of her nature and circumstances throughout most of the movie. Her final act of consuming Lee ""bones and all"" is done out of love and desperation rather than a true reclamation of agency, reinforcing her entrapment within her monstrous identity.",3,2,1,1,2,2
Jennifer's Body,2009,Karyn Kusama,F,Megan Fox,F,A newly possessed cheerleader turns into a killer who specializes in offing her male classmates. Can her best friend put an end to the horror?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer%27s_Body,"Anita ""Needy"" Lesnicki, once an insecure and studious teenager living in the small town of Devil's Kettle, Minnesota, is now a violent mental inmate who narrates the story as a flashback while in solitary confinement.

Since childhood, Needy has been best friends with Jennifer Check, a popular and beautiful high school color guard flag spinner, despite the two having little in common. Jennifer often mistreats and dominates Needy, who is too in awe of her to stand up for herself. One night, Jennifer takes Needy to a local dive bar to attend a concert by the indie rock band Low Shoulder. A fire engulfs the bar, killing several people. Jennifer, in shock from the fire, leaves with the band even though Needy tells her not to. Later that evening, she appears in Needy's kitchen, covered in blood, and attempts to eat a rotisserie chicken. She immediately vomits a trail of black fluid and almost bites Needy's neck, but retreats and leaves.

The next morning at school, Jennifer appears fine and dismisses Needy's concerns, appearing apathetic to the fire tragedy. She seduces the school's football captain and lures him into the woods where she disembowels and cannibalizes him. Meanwhile, Low Shoulder gains popularity due to their falsely rumored heroism during the fire, and offer to make a charity appearance at the school's spring formal.

A month later, Jennifer appears sick and listless. She accepts a date with school alternative/emo Colin, whom she invites to an abandoned house; once there she brutally kills and devours him. While Needy and her boyfriend Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened and has a disturbing vision of a demonic Jennifer. She flees back home but on the way she is accosted by Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. After making it home unhurt, Needy finds a revitalized and amorous Jennifer in her bed. Jennifer attempts to seduce Needy by kissing her; Needy initially reciprocates but then comes to her senses and demands an explanation.

Jennifer reveals that Low Shoulder had taken her into the woods after the bar fire and offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice was a success, Jennifer was not actually a virgin, so she became permanently possessed. She became hungry and Ahmet, a foreign exchange student, who was thought to have died in the fire, was her first victim. She had intended to eat Needy as well, but left because she could not bring herself to hurt her best friend. When she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, healing instantly.

Needy goes to the school library's occult section and determines that Jennifer is a succubus who must feed on flesh and can only be killed while she is hungry and weak. Needy tells Chip about Jennifer. He does not believe her, so she breaks up with him in order to protect him. Jennifer intercepts Chip on the way to the school dance and lies to him, saying that Needy had been cheating on him with Colin. She takes him to an abandoned pool and begins feeding on him. Needy arrives and Chip impales Jennifer through the stomach with a pool skimmer. Jennifer escapes and Chip dies.

Angry and heartbroken, Needy breaks into Jennifer's bedroom. The two fight and Jennifer bites Needy's shoulder in the struggle. Needy rips Jennifer's bestfriend necklace off her neck. Jennifer stops fighting back and Needy stabs her in the heart with a utility knife, killing her and destroying the demon. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy on top of her dead daughter's body. Needy is brought to an asylum. She now manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers due to the bite. She escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride, telling the driver she is following a band.

A home video and crime scene photos show that the members of Low Shoulder have been murdered in their hotel by Needy.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Gender-based Violence**: The film explores themes of gender-based violence through the sacrifice of Jennifer by the band Low Shoulder. They exploit her vulnerability, resulting in her becoming a succubus, a metaphor for how violence can transform and victimize women. The movie vividly portrays Jennifer's transition from victim to a monstrous entity.

2. **Female Sexuality (such as coming of age)**: Jennifer's transformation into a succubus is closely tied to her sexual identity. Her physical allure and violence become tools for survival, exploring the often predatory nature of sexual awakening and the pressures on female sexuality in adolescence.

### Role of Main Protagonist

1. **Adolescent girl**: Both Needy and Jennifer are high school teenagers dealing with the complexities of adolescence. Their roles center around their high school experiences and relationships, fitting the category of ""Adolescent girl.""

### Monstrous Feminine

1. **Monstrous Feminine (Succubus)**: Jennifer's character fits the concept of ""monstrous feminine"" as she becomes a succubus— a demon that feeds on human flesh. Her transformation into a predatory entity reflects a monstrous version of femininity.

### Protagonist's Fate

1. **Survives**: Needy survives the events of the movie. She gains supernatural powers and escapes from the mental facility to seek revenge on the band members, showcasing her resilience and transformation.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment

1. **Empowerment**: While both Needy and Jennifer experience significant victimization, the story ultimately leans towards Needy’s empowerment. Needy transitions from a vulnerable, submissive teenager to a proactive individual who takes control of her story. She not only kills the demonic Jennifer but also avenges the wrongs done to her and Jennifer by the band, gaining agency and autonomy in the process.

mother!,2017,Darren Aronofsky,M,Jennifer Lawrence,F,"A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother!,"In the burned-out remains of a large house, Him, an acclaimed poet struggling with writer's block, places a crystal object on a pedestal in his study, and the building morphs into a beautiful home in an edenic landscape. Mother, the poet's wife and muse, awakens in her bed and wonders aloud where Him is. While renovating the house, she occasionally visualizes a beating heart within its walls.

One day, a stranger called Man turns up at the house, claiming to be an orthopedic surgeon and asking for a room. That night, Man suffers from dry heaves and Mother observes a wound on his side. Man's wife, Woman, arrives the next day. Mother is increasingly frustrated by her guests, but Him begs her to let them stay, revealing that Man is actually a fan whose dying wish was to meet Him. However, when Man and Woman accidentally shatter the crystal object, Him becomes angry and boards up his study. Man and Woman's two sons arrive unexpectedly and fight over Man's will. Oldest Son wounds his brother, and then flees after having his head smashed against glass by Him, leaving a bloody gash in Younger Brother's head.

Him, Man, and Woman take the injured son to the hospital. Mother cleans up and notices strange damage to the house, including a fly, a frog, and blood that will not stop dripping. She follows the blood to a tank of heating oil hidden behind the basement walls. Him informs Mother that Younger Brother has died.

Mother and Him are roused that night when dozens of people arrive unannounced at the house to mourn the dead son. The visitors behave in rude and presumptuous ways that irritate Mother, and she snaps and orders everyone to leave when they break a sink, partially flooding the house. She berates Him for allowing so many people inside and ignoring her needs, but their argument leads to passionate lovemaking. The next morning, Mother announces she is pregnant, which elates Him and inspires him to start writing again.

Some time later, Mother prepares for the child's arrival and reads Him's beautiful new poem. Upon publication, it is acclaimed and sells well. In celebration, Mother prepares a big dinner, but a group of fans interrupt. Mother tries to lock the doors, but droves of fans pour inside and begin to wreak havoc, damaging the house. Him is oblivious, but a disoriented Mother watches helplessly as military forces turn up to battle members of the cult that has sprung up around Him; his publicist organizes mass executions. Mother goes into labor and Him reopens his study so she can give birth inside.

The havoc outside subsides. Him finds that the fans have left gifts and are waiting. Him tells Mother that his fans want to see their newborn son. She asks why he won't make them leave, and he says he doesn't want them to. She refuses to hand over the boy to Him. Eventually, she falls asleep, and Him takes the child outside to the crowd. They pass the baby around wildly until he is inadvertently killed. Mother finds people eating her son's mutilated corpse. Furious, she attacks them. They turn on her and beat her savagely until Him intervenes. He begs Mother to forgive them, but she runs down to the basement oil tank and ignites the oil, causing an explosion that incinerates the crowd and destroys the house.

Him is unscathed by the inferno, but Mother is horrifically burned. She asks him what he is, and he replies, ""I am I"" and Mother was ""home"". He asks for her love, and, when she agrees, reaches into her chest and removes her heart, which he tears open to reveal a new crystal object. He places it on the pedestal and the house is transformed back into a beautiful home. A new Mother appears in the bed and awakens, wondering aloud where Him is.","In an interview, Lawrence stated that the film is an allegory and ""depicts the rape and torment of Mother Earth ... I represent Mother Earth; Javier, whose character is a poet, represents a form of God, a creator; Michelle Pfeiffer is an Eve to Ed Harris's Adam, there's Cain and Abel and the setting sometimes resembles the Garden of Eden"".[5]

Aronofsky said the exclamation mark in the title ""reflects the spirit of the film"", which ends with ""a big exclamation point"". He discussed the film's unusual choice of not capitalizing the letter 'm' in the title during a Reddit interview, saying: ""To find out why there's a lowercase 'm', read the credits and look for the letter that is capitalised. Ask yourself what's another name for this character?"" (In the credits, the characters' names are all shown in lowercase, except for Him.)","### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth):** The protagonist, referred to as Mother, experiences pregnancy and childbirth. These themes are central to the story as her pregnancy brings hope but ultimately leads to tragedy when her baby is killed.
  
2. **Gender-based violence (such as sexual or physical assault or abuse):** Mother is subjected to increasing invasions of her home and personal space, culminating in the brutal killing and consumption of her newborn son and her own physical assault by the crowd. This can be seen as an allegory for the violation and abuse Mother Earth endures.

### Protagonist's Role

1. **Mother or housewife:** The protagonist is clearly in the role of a housewife and later a mother. She spends much of the movie maintaining and caring for the home and later focuses on her impending motherhood.

### Monstruous Feminine

1. **Monstruous feminine (archaic mother, monstrous womb, vampire, witch, possessed body, monstrous mother and castrator):** The protagonist can be considered as the ""archaic mother"" and ""monstrous mother."" She embodies the fertile and nurturing aspects of womanhood but also exhibits destructive power in the end when she decides to kill herself and destroy the house to rid herself of the invaders.

### Protagonist's Fate

1. **Dies:** The protagonist dies in the end after setting the house on fire, resulting in an explosion that kills both herself and the invaders.

### Focus of the Story

1. **Victimization:** The story is more about female victimization. Throughout the movie, the protagonist is subjected to physical and psychological threats, invasion of her personal space, and the ultimate horror of losing her child in the most brutal manner. She never gains significant agency or autonomy, and her attempts to secure her own space are in vain.",1,1,1,1,1,1
The Exorcist,1973,William Friedkin,M,Ellen Burstyn,F,"12-year-old Regan MacNeil begins to adapt an explicit new personality as strange events befall the local area of Georgetown. Her mother becomes torn between science and superstition in a desperate bid to save her daughter, and ultimately turns to her last hope: Father Damien Karras, a troubled priest who is struggling with his own faith.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist,"In northern Iraq, priest Lankester Merrin takes part in an archaeological dig in the ancient ruins of Hatra. During the dig, he finds a stone talisman of a winged being that evokes a concerned look on his face. He then has a vision in which a giant version of the same being appears nearby, silently confronting him.

In Georgetown, Washington, D.C., actress Chris MacNeil is starring in a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. MacNeil, along with her 12-year old daughter Regan, rents a luxurious house with hired help. Meanwhile, Father Damien Karras, a psychiatrist who counsels Georgetown University priests, visits his ailing mother in New York. He later confides to a colleague that he is having a crisis of faith.

Chris hosts a party with Karras's friend, Father Dyer, who explains Karras's role as counselor and notes his mother's recent death. Regan, seemingly unwell, appears and urinates before Chris comforts her. Regan's bed shakes violently after Chris returns her to it. Later, Dyer consoles Karras, guilty at not having been with his mother when she died.

Regan's personality becomes violent. Medical tests find no physical cause. During a house call, Regan exhibits abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan; Dennings is found dead at the bottom of a set of public stairs that begin beneath Regan's window. Detective William Kinderman questions Karras, confiding that Dennings's head was turned backwards. Regan's body becomes covered with sores. Kinderman tells Chris that the only plausible explanation for Dennings's death is that he was pushed from Regan's window. As Kinderman leaves, Regan has another violent fit, stabbing her vagina with a crucifix and turning her head backwards. She is confined to her bedroom. Chris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. The possessed Regan claims to be the Devil, and vomits into Karras's face while speaking in tongues. The demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. At night, Chris's assistant calls Karras to the house; he concludes that an exorcism is warranted. His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest lead the ritual. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned.

Merrin arrives at the house. As the two priests read from the Roman Ritual, the demon curses them. The priests rest and Merrin, shaking, takes nitroglycerin. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother, perturbing Karras despite his denials. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead from a heart attack while Regan watches by and laughs. Karras beats the possessed Regan in a fit of rage and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips the medallion of Saint Joseph from Karras's neck and possesses him, freeing Regan in the process. Karras jumps out the window, tumbling down the stone stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed Regan, and Kinderman surveys the scene. Outside, Dyer administers the dying Karras last rites.

The MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal, Regan, moved by the sight of Dyer's clerical collar, kisses him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave, Chris offers Dyer the medallion found in Regan's room, but he refuses, telling her to keep it. Dyer briefly examines the steps where Karras died before walking away.","Critics and scholars attributed The Exorcist's box office success to social anxiety following the cultural, political and social upheavals of the late 1960s.[6][78][225][226] ""The Exorcist communicates an image of a United States in an unstable state of change that can no longer avoid its real and historical systemic evils"", writes Amy Chambers.[78] Kermode noted that by stylistically distancing itself from the more Gothic horror films of the 1960s, the film ""presented a credible portrait of the modern urban world ripped apart by an obscene, ancient evil.""[227] Stephen King calls The Exorcist ""a social horror film if there ever was one"" in his 1983 treatise on the genre, Danse Macabre. He sees the possessed Regan symbolizing for middle-aged viewers the outspoken youth protesting the Vietnam War;[228] Danny Peary likewise notes the symbolic and real fragmentation throughout the film: ""With the world in such disorder, the Devil can make a dramatic entrance.""[73]

At the time of the film's release, the Watergate scandal was worsening, implicating President Richard Nixon. In 2019, The A.V. Club's Tom Breihan said that ""the spectacle of The Exorcist might've mirrored"" Watergate.[229] In a Christian Century article, theologian Carl Raschke connected the ""psychodramas of the American soul"" resulting from ""the cynical mood of our age [arising] by default from the wreck of traditional religious as well as social values.""[230] Breihan reads the film itself as reactionary, ""built on reverence of tradition"" despite its surface transgressiveness. ""[It] almost sneers at the politics of the ’60s"", he writes, noting Chris dismissing her film's take on student protest as ""the Walt Disney version of the Ho Chi Minh story"". In the only scene she is shown shooting, her character, a faculty member at the fictional college, counsels a group of protesters that change can only come from the system.[229]

Feminism has figured in discussions of The Exorcist. At the time, the U.S. women's liberation movement had enjoyed some early gains in legislatures and courts. Commentators have seen the film, in which a single working mother and her uncontrollable daughter are rescued by patriarchal authority, as a reaction against feminism.[229][6][231] Former studio executive Peter Biskind, in Easy Riders and Raging Bulls, describes the film as ""a male nightmare of female puberty. Emergent female sexuality is equated with demonic possession."" For the male authority figures in The Exorcist, whether priests or physicians, Regan must be restored to her innocence through abusive and violent means if necessary.[174] Many feminist critics, like Biskind, note the film's focus on the female body as the site of horror. ""When her body changes, Regan becomes someone else; someone sexual, whose desire is a dark visitor"" writes Jude Ellison Doyle in Dead Blondes and Bad Mothers: Monstrosity, Patriarchy and the Fear of Female Power. ""To become a woman is to become the ... enemy of all that is pure or holy.""[232] But Australian film studies professor Barbara Creed, in The Monstrous-Feminine, which inaugurated psychoanalytic feminist film theory, counters the prevailing feminist take on The Exorcist by insisting that Pazuzu is female[233] and thus the possession of Regan is itself a feminist act, exposing ""the inability of the male order to control the woman whose perversity is expressed through her rebellious body"",[234] as she navigates an incestuous desire for her mother.[235] University of Toronto professor S. Trimble writes that the film tapped into ""white American fears of nightmare futures"" that could result from the women's liberation, gay liberation and Black Power movements' challenge to the established 1970s social order. As a film about ""a revolting girl revolting against the little-girl box in which she was stuck"" and army of men trying to put her back, The Exorcist follows older horror movies that use gender-bending to create a monster, Trimble notes.[236]

Texas State religious studies professor Joseph Laycock[237] wrote that the popular embrace of The Exorcist also pointed to reactionary popular trends in American religion. ""The Exorcist is a depiction not of ecclesiastical Catholicism but of folk piety"", which he also describes as extra-ecclesiastical religion, pursued by the lay masses, ""incorporat[ing] beliefs about divine or supernatural intervention in the realm of everyday experience"", as tolerant of Ouija boards and practices from other spiritual traditions as it was devout in its Catholic faith.[238] In the early 1970s, organized religion in America had increasingly turned towards the rational as the country became more secular: ""The authentic folk piety depicted in The Exorcist likely appealed to audiences [at the time] because it was a welcome alternative to rationalized religion and a cultural myth of universal secularization.""","**The Exorcist**

**Two Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. **Female Sexuality**: The film has been interpreted as a representation of emergent female sexuality, with Regan's demonic possession coinciding with her puberty. The transformation she undergoes can be seen as symbolic of the fears and anxieties surrounding female sexual maturation.
2. **Gender-Based Violence**: The movie heavily focuses on Regan, a young girl, being subjected to exorcism rituals, which involve significant physical and psychological abuse under the guise of attempting to ""purify"" her. Critics have noted that this aligns with patriarchal attempts to control or ""discipline"" female bodies and behavior.

**Main Protagonist Role:**
- **Adolescent Girl**: Regan is a 12-year-old girl, making her role fit into the category of an adolescent girl. Her experiences and transformations drive much of the film's narrative and thematic exploration.

**Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster in the Story?**
- **Monstrous Feminine**: Regan becomes possessed by a demonic entity, which portrays her as having a ""possessed body"" and aligns with Barbara Creed's concept of the Monstrous-Feminine. The depiction of her possession showcases her as a feared and untamed entity, traditionally seen as monstrous due to the chaos and uncontrollable nature associated with her condition.

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?**
- **Survives**: At the end of the film, Regan is freed from the demonic possession and survives the ordeal.

**Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?**
- **Victimization**: The narrative predominantly focuses on Regan as a victim of possession and the subsequent physical and psychological threats she faces. She does not gain significant agency or autonomy; rather, the story revolves around her survival and the efforts of male authority figures to save her. Her role and experiences are primarily characterized by her need for rescue and the extreme measures taken to ""restore"" her to an innocent state.",3,2,1,1,2,1
Annihilation,2018,Alex Garland,M,Natalie Portman,F,"A biologist signs up for a dangerous, secret expedition into a mysterious zone where the laws of nature don't apply.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(film),"Cellular biology professor and former U.S. Army soldier Lena is under interrogation. She was part of an expedition to an anomalous zone known as the Shimmer, but she was the only one to return. The Shimmer emerged three years prior from a meteor that landed on a lighthouse in the St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge in Florida, and it is gradually expanding and increasing its boundaries. Many exploratory expeditions were organized, but only Lena's husband, Kane, returns home after a year of absence. Kane cannot explain where he was and how he came back, and his condition quickly deteriorates. Lena calls an ambulance, but she and Kane are intercepted by security forces and taken to a secret facility.

As Kane is put in intensive care, psychologist Dr. Ventress prepares a new scientific expedition into the Shimmer, and Lena joins her. Three other women participate in the expedition: Cass, a geomorphologist; Anya, a paramedic; and Josie, a physicist.

Communication equipment does not function within the Shimmer's territory, and the expedition encounters unusually mutated plants and animals. Josie is attacked by an albino alligator with several concentric rows of teeth. At an abandoned military base, the group finds a video message from Kane's expedition, in which Kane cuts open another soldier's abdomen with a knife to reveal slithering intestines. The group finds the soldier's corpse, which has turned into an overgrown colony of lichens.

At night, Lena and Ventress share a watch and reflect on humanity's strange instinct to destabilize and destroy itself. They're joined later by Cassie, and the base is attacked by a mutant bear that drags Cassie away. Lena later finds her mutilated corpse. Within an abandoned village, Josie studies plants that have taken on a humanoid form, and theorizes that the Shimmer functions as a prism, distorting and transforming everything that falls within its boundaries—including the expedition members' own DNA. Anya, overcome with paranoia after watching her fingerprints change, disarms the other members and ties them to chairs, and accuses Lena of murdering Cassie. The mutant bear returns and lures Anya away by emitting a cry for help in Cassie's voice. The bear kills Anya, while Josie frees herself and shoots the bear.

Ventress leaves the group and heads for the lighthouse, the center of the Shimmer. Josie believes Cassie's dying mind was ""refracted"" into the bear, and laments that the only piece left of Cassie was the pain and fear she experienced while being killed. She allows herself to succumb to the shimmer and ""refract"" into a humanoid plant, hoping to avoid a similar fate. Lena follows Ventress to the lighthouse, where she discovers Kane's remains and a videotape. In the footage, Kane leaves an instruction to find Lena before killing himself with a phosphorus grenade. After the explosion, a doppelgänger of Kane steps into frame.

Within the hole created by the meteor, Lena finds Ventress, who explains that the Shimmer will eventually swallow everything. Ventress then disintegrates into a shimmering cloud that absorbs a drop of blood from Lena's face and changes into a faceless, shimmering, humanoid being that mimics Lena's movements. Unable to escape the creature, Lena tricks it into igniting one of Kane's leftover grenades as it transforms into her doppelgänger. Lena flees the burning lighthouse, and the Shimmer dissipates, destroying itself as it mindlessly mimics the explosion.

Back in the present, Lena's interrogation concludes, and she learns that after the Shimmer fell, Kane's condition began to stabilize. Lena visits the Kane doppelgänger and asks if he is really Kane, which he doubts. He asks if she is Lena, but she does not answer. They embrace and their irises shimmer.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

Smile,2022,Parker Finn,M,Sosie Bacon,F,"After witnessing a bizarre, traumatic incident involving a patient, Dr. Rose Cotter starts experiencing frightening occurrences that she can't explain. As an overwhelming terror begins taking over her life, Rose must confront her troubling past in order to survive and escape her horrifying new reality.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile_(2022_film),"At a psychiatric ward, therapist Rose Cotter meets graduate student Laura Weaver,[a] who explains that she recently witnessed her professor kill himself. Laura claims she is being terrorized by an invisible entity that appears as various smiling people and has foretold her death. She begins screaming and panicking, prompting Rose to call for help; Laura suddenly becomes unnaturally calm and smiles, then fatally slits her own throat, terrifying Rose.

The next day, a patient named Carl smiles like Laura did and shouts to Rose that she is going to die. Rose calls for nurses to restrain Carl, only to realize Carl has been asleep the entire time. Concerned for Rose's mental well-being, her supervisor, Dr. Morgan Desai, orders Rose to take a week off. Rose's hallucinations continue, leading those around her to believe she may be a danger to herself. Rose visits her former therapist, Dr. Madeline Northcott, who suggests that Rose's problems stem from her childhood, in which she witnessed the overdose death of her abusive and mentally ill mother.

Later, Rose attends a birthday party for her nephew, the son of her older sister, Holly. When he unwraps her present, he finds Rose's dead cat, which has somehow replaced the present, horrifying everyone. Rose has a public breakdown and sees a guest smiling unnaturally at her, causing her to fall into a glass coffee table and injure herself. This convinces Rose that she has fallen victim to a curse, although her fiancé Trevor believes she has gone crazy.

Upon learning that Laura's professor was smiling at her before his death, Rose visits the professor's widow, Victoria, and learns that he had also witnessed a suicide shortly before his own. Rose asks her ex-boyfriend Joel, a police detective, to review old police records. They find several cases of people who witnessed someone commit suicide while smiling at them before doing the same to themselves within a week.

Rose tries to patch things up with Trevor but becomes enraged after realizing he has called Madeline to provide psychological intervention without asking Rose first. Upset, she leaves to speak with Holly, who also dismisses Rose's belief in a curse. Holly compares Rose's behavior to their late mother, and Rose accuses Holly of abandoning her before their mother's death.

Rose and Joel discover the sole exception in the chain of suicides: convicted murderer Robert Talley. Rose and Joel visit him in jail, where he claims that the entity feeds on trauma and that the only way to escape it is to brutally kill someone else in front of a witness to traumatize them, passing the curse to the witness. Rose angrily rejects this idea. The entity appears at her home in Madeline's form and taunts her. Rose drives to her hospital with a knife and murders Carl in front of Morgan, but it is revealed to be a hallucination. Rose wakes up in her car to find Morgan standing outside. He notices the knife, but she speeds away, prompting him to alert the police.

Rose drives to her abandoned family home, realizing she cannot pass on the entity's curse if she dies alone. The entity appears as Rose's mother, and it is revealed that Rose chose not to call for help for her mother because of her abusive behavior. The entity attacks Rose, and a fire starts in the struggle, seemingly killing the entity. Rose flees the house and returns to Joel's apartment. Joel smiles at Rose, who realizes this is another hallucination.

In reality, Joel has tracked Rose's phone to her old house and finds her outside. Rose panics and runs back inside, where the entity reveals its true form – a skinless, semi-humanoid monstrosity with multiple sets of malformed jaws nesting within an enormous, smiling mouth. The sight of the entity's visage causes Rose to fall into a trance, and the entity possesses her by forcing itself inside her body through her mouth. Joel breaks down the front door and sees a smiling Rose set herself on fire, passing the curse onto him.

It Chapter Two,2019,Andy Muschietti,M,Jessica Chastain,F,"27 years after overcoming the malevolent supernatural entity Pennywise, the former members of the Losers' Club, who have grown up and moved away from Derry, are brought back together by a devastating phone call.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Chapter_Two,"In 2016, twenty-seven years after It's initial defeat[a], Pennywise returns to Derry, Maine, killing a man named Adrian Mellon after he and his boyfriend are brutally assaulted by homophobic teens.

Mike Hanlon, the only member of the Losers Club who remained in Derry, summons the other members, Bill Denbrough, Ben Hanscom, Beverly Marsh, Richie Tozier, Eddie Kaspbrak, and Stanley Uris. All of them return to Derry, except for Stanley, who commits suicide. Mike refreshes the Losers' memories before It itself reveals the news of Stanley's suicide to them. Richie and Eddie decide to leave, until Beverly reveals that she has had visions of their deaths should they fail to fulfill their oath to kill It. Meanwhile, It lures and kills a young girl with a facial birthmark at a baseball game.

At the library, Mike shows Bill, via a drug-induced vision, that the Native American ""Ritual of Chüd"" can defeat It using items from the Losers' past. Bill goes to the storm drain where Georgie was killed and recovers his paper sailboat. Beverly retrieves Ben's love letter from her childhood home, before being attacked by It in the form of a demonic elderly woman. Richie goes to an abandoned cinema where he collects a game token and encounters Pennywise, who confronts him on his hidden homosexuality. Ben returns to the town's high school, while Eddie recovers an inhaler from a pharmacy and is attacked by the Leper.

Meanwhile, Henry Bowers is freed from a mental hospital by It. Bowers viciously attacks Eddie at the Losers' hotel before driving to the library. There, Bowers attacks Mike before Richie impales him. At a carnival, Bill fails to save a young boy from It. Distraught, Bill travels to the Neibolt House, where the Losers convince him not to face It alone.

With their memories now fully restored, the group descends into a cavern beneath the sewers. Mike provides a rock from the Losers' fight with the Bowers Gang, and they perform the ritual in the remains of the meteor that brought It to Earth. The ritual fails as It emerges as an enormous Pennywise-spider hybrid and pressures Mike into revealing that the ritual killed the original native performers. It attacks the Losers and places Bill, Ben, and Beverly in individual hallucinations. They escape once Bill releases his guilt over being indirectly responsible for Georgie's death and when Beverly realizes Ben was the one who wrote the love letter to her. When Richie is made catatonic by It, Eddie saves him but is fatally impaled. A weakened Eddie then explains how he made It feel small earlier, by choking the Leper nearly to death.

The Losers confront It about how they have overcome their fears, and are no longer scared of the entity, causing It to shrink to a small weakened Pennywise. Mike rips out It's heart, which he and the Losers crush with their bare hands, finally killing It. They return to Eddie to find he has died from his injuries, and are forced to leave his body behind as It's cavern implodes, destroying the Neibolt House.

At the water-logged quarry, the Losers comfort Richie, and Ben and Beverly kiss. Later, the scars on the Losers' hands disappear. After the Losers part ways, Ben and Beverly get married, Richie returns to the kissing bridge where he had once carved his and Eddie's initials, Mike moves out of Derry, and Bill begins writing his new story. Mike reveals to Bill that Stanley had written the Losers letters prior to his suicide; Stanley was too scared to face It, and his suicide was intended to strengthen his friends against It. His last words in the letters indicate that they will always be Losers.",,"Based on the plot of ""It Chapter Two,"" here's the analysis:

A Quiet Place Part II,2020,John Krasinski,M,Emily Blunt,F,"Following the events at home, the Abbott family now face the terrors of the outside world. Forced to venture into the unknown, they realize that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_Part_II,"During a Little League Baseball game in the small town of Millbrook, New York, the Abbott family – wife Evelyn, husband Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and hearing sons Marcus and Beau – and other spectators witness a strange meteor-like object hurtle toward the Earth. Shortly after, hostile extraterrestrial creatures emerge from the meteor and begin slaughtering the townspeople. The blind creatures possess armored skin and extraordinary speed and strength, and track victims with hypersensitive hearing, attacking anything that makes even the slightest noise.

Over a year later, the creatures have killed much of the Earth's population, including Lee and Beau.[a] Regan has discovered that high-frequency audio feedback makes them vulnerable, and devises a makeshift method of transmitting the noise from her cochlear implant through a portable microphone. With their home destroyed, the family search for other survivors. Entering a fenced-off area, Evelyn accidentally sets off a sound alarm, alerting the creatures. As they flee, Marcus steps into a bear trap, attracting a creature with his screams. Regan and Evelyn kill the creature, free Marcus, and run into an abandoned steel foundry.

An old friend, Emmett, takes them to his soundproof underground hideout. Emmett, who has recently lost his family and developed a cynical outlook on life, refuses to help further. Marcus hears the song ""Beyond the Sea"" playing on the radio, and Emmett says the song has aired continuously for four months. Regan determines it is a hint that survivors are on a nearby island a day's travel to the southeast. She theorizes that if she can reach the island's radio tower the hearing aid's high-frequency noise can be broadcast so other survivors can weaponize the signal. She ventures out alone to find the island but is attacked; Emmett saves her from a creature. Regan persuades him to help complete her mission. Evelyn leaves Marcus and her newborn baby at the foundry to fetch medical supplies in town. Marcus discovers the corpse of Emmett's wife. Startled, he alerts a creature and, in trying to flee, accidentally locks himself and the baby inside an air-tight compartment.

Emmett and Regan arrive at a marina to board a boat to the island. They are attacked by bandits, and Emmett deliberately attracts creatures that slaughter the attackers. When one creature drowns, he realizes that the creatures cannot swim. The two row to the island where a small colony of survivors are living normally. The colony leader reveals that when the U.S. government discovered the creatures were unable to swim, the U.S. National Guard attempted to move people to the islands. However, the chaos from boarding created noise that attracted the creatures, leaving only two boats that made it to the island.

Evelyn returns to the foundry and frees her children before they suffocate. The three hide inside the bunker as the creature prowls the foundry. At the island the next day, a creature that's drifted to the island attacks the colonists and kills the colony leader. At the radio station, Regan transmits the high frequency via the station's signal and plays it over the station's speakers, incapacitating the creature, and then killing it with a metal pole.

At the foundry, Marcus picks up Regan's transmission and plays the high-pitched frequency through his portable radio before shooting the creature dead. Regan leaves the hearing aid connected to the radio station's microphone, allowing the broadcast signal to be weaponized by others.",,"### Analysis of ""A Quiet Place Part II""

Instead, Daniel alerts his family, who arrive in ceremonial masks and robes. Despite his bride Helene's pleas, Charles is shot with a speargun and dragged away into a locked room.

Thirty years later, Daniel's brother Alex, the estranged son of the owners of the successful Le Domas Family Games company, is set to marry Grace, a former foster child. On Alex and Grace’s wedding day, she meets the le Domases: Daniel and his wife Charity; Alex's cocaine-addicted sister Emilie, her husband Fitch, and their young sons Georgie and Gabe; Alex's Aunt Helene, and his parents Tony and Becky. After the ceremony, Tony explains that his ancestor Victor le Domas made a deal with someone named ""le Bail"" to build the Le Domas fortune in exchange for the family observing a tradition: at midnight on their wedding day, every new member draws a game card from Le Bail's puzzle box. Grace draws ""Hide-and-Seek"". Believing it to be a harmless game, Grace goes to hide herself as the Le Domases each receive a weapon. Alex finds Grace, who witnesses Emilie accidentally kill a maid whom she mistakes for Grace.

Alex reveals that his family is cursed: if the new member draws the Hide-and-Seek card, the rest of the family has to find and ritually sacrifice them before dawn or they die instead. The game was last played by Helene's husband, Charles. With the mansion locked down, Alex disables the security system to allow Grace to escape. She is discovered by Daniel, who is disillusioned with his family and gives her a head start before alerting the others; in the chaos Emilie accidentally kills another maid. Grace's escape is blocked by the family butler, Stevens. She, in turn, splatters the hot tea he was preparing on his face and runs away. Alex is restrained by Daniel and Tony after he attacks the latter. Grace is seen by a third maid who accidentally crushes herself in a dumbwaiter while yelling for the family.

Grace runs to the goatshed where Georgie shoots her in the hand. She knocks him out but is startled by a goat and falls into a pit filled with the corpses of the Le Domases' previous sacrifices, including that of Charles. She escapes and makes it through the front gate. Grace is pursued into the forest by Stevens. She fights Stevens off but is eventually captured by him. As he is driving Grace back to the house, she awakens and attacks Stevens, causing the car to crash and kill him. Daniel, nearby the crash, captures Grace after realizing that his father is secretly watching.

The Le Domases prepare to complete the ritual sacrifice, however they are incapacitated after Daniel poisoned them with a non-lethal dose of hydrochloric acid in the ritual cup. Charity shoots Daniel in the neck after he attempts to protect Grace, leaving him to bleed to death as Grace runs away. In the ongoing chaos, the mansion is set on fire, and Grace is attacked by Becky, whom she beats to death with Le Bail's box.

Alex escapes his restraints and goes to find Grace, but witnesses her attacking his mother. Grace pulls away from Alex, who after realizing that she will never trust him and will almost certainly leave him once she escapes, subdues her to complete the ritual. Grace breaks free from the ritual table just as the sun rises. Despite Grace having won the game, Helene attempts to attack her anyway but explodes midstride, a consequence of the curse. The rest of the family explode one by one, leaving only Alex, who tries to convince Grace to forgive him. She refuses and tosses her ring back, declaring she wants a divorce; Alex then succumbs to the curse and explodes. Le Bail briefly shows himself to Grace and nods in approval.

The sole survivor of the night, Grace walks out of the burning manor just as the police arrive. Upon asking her what happened, she simply replies ""in-laws"".

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,1974,Tobe Hooper,M,Marilyn Burns,F,"When Sally hears that her grandfather's grave may have been vandalized, she and her paraplegic brother, Franklin, set out with their friends to investigate. After a detour to their family's old farmhouse, they discover a group of crazed, murderous outcasts living next door. As the group is attacked one by one by the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface, who wears a mask of human skin, the survivors must do everything they can to escape.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre,"In the early hours of August 18, 1973, a grave robber steals several remains from a cemetery near Newt, Muerto County, Texas. The robber ties a rotting corpse and other body parts onto a monument, creating a grisly display which is discovered by a local resident as the sun rises.

Driving in a van, five young people take a road trip through the area: Sally Hardesty, Jerry, Pam, Kirk, and Sally's handicapped brother Franklin. They stop at the cemetery to check on the grave of Sally and Franklin's grandfather, which appears undisturbed. As the group drive past a slaughterhouse, Franklin recounts the Hardesty family's history with animal slaughter. They pick up a hitchhiker who says that his own family also has experience with animal slaughter. When the group refuse to pay the hitchhiker for a photograph, he attacks Franklin and smears a bloody symbol on the side of the van as he is ejected. Low on gas, the van stops at a station whose proprietor says that no fuel is available. The group explore a nearby abandoned house, owned by the Hardesty family.

Kirk and Pam leave the others behind, planning to go swimming. They discover another nearby house, running gas-powered generators. Hoping to barter for gas, Kirk enters the house. A large man wearing a mask made of skin attacks Kirk with a hammer, killing him. When Pam enters the house, she finds its living room strewn with human and animal bones. The man grabs her, impales her on a meat hook, and starts up a gas-powered chainsaw to dismember Kirk's body as Pam watches. In the evening, Jerry searches for Pam and Kirk. When he enters the other house, he finds Pam's nearly-dead, spasming body in a chest freezer. The masked man kills Jerry with a hammer.

At night, Sally and Franklin start towards the other house. The masked man ambushes them, killing Franklin with the chainsaw. The man chases Sally into the house, where she finds a very old, seemingly dead man and a woman's rotting corpse. The masked man chases Sally back to the gas station and vanishes. The station's proprietor comforts Sally for a moment, after which he beats and subdues her, loading her into his pickup truck. The proprietor drives to the other house, and the hitchhiker appears. The proprietor scolds him for his actions at the cemetery, identifying the hitchhiker as the grave robber. As they enter the house, the masked man reappears, dressed in women's clothing. The proprietor identifies the masked man and the hitchhiker as brothers, and the hitchhiker refers to the masked man as ""Leatherface"". The two brothers bring the old man—""Grandpa""—down the stairs and cut Sally's finger so that Grandpa can suck her blood. Sally faints.

The next morning, Sally regains consciousness. The men taunt her and bicker with each other, resolving to kill her with a hammer. They try to include Grandpa in the activity, but Grandpa's grip is weak, and he drops the hammer repeatedly. Sally breaks free and runs onto a road in front of the house, pursued by the brothers. An oncoming truck accidentally runs over the hitchhiker, killing him. The truck driver attacks Leatherface with a large wrench, injuring him, and escapes on foot. Sally, covered in blood, flags down a passing pickup truck and climbs into the bed, narrowly escaping Leatherface. As the pickup drives away, Sally laughs giddily. Leatherface flails his chainsaw in frustration as the sun rises.

","Contemporary American life
Hooper's apocalyptic landscape is ... a desert wasteland of dissolution where once vibrant myth is desiccated. The ideas and iconography of Cooper, Bret Harte and Francis Parkman are now transmogrified into yards of dying cattle, abandoned gasoline stations, defiled graveyards, crumbling mansions, and a ramshackle farmhouse of psychotic killers. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre [is] ... recognizable as a statement about the dead end of American experience.

— Christopher Sharrett[142]

Critic Christopher Sharrett argues that since Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), the American horror film has been defined by the questions it poses ""about the fundamental validity of the American civilizing process"",[143] concerns amplified during the 1970s by the ""delegitimation of authority in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate"".[144] ""If Psycho began an exploration of a new sense of absurdity in contemporary life, of the collapse of causality and the diseased underbelly of American Gothic"", he writes, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ""carries this exploration to a logical conclusion, addressing many of the issues of Hitchcock's film while refusing comforting closure"".[145]

Robin Wood characterizes Leatherface and his family as victims of industrial capitalism, their jobs as slaughterhouse workers having been rendered obsolete by technological advances.[146] He states that the picture ""brings to focus a spirit of negativity ... that seems to lie not far below the surface of the modern collective consciousness"".[147] Naomi Merritt explores the film's representation of ""cannibalistic capitalism"" in relation to Georges Bataille's theory of taboo and transgression.[148] She elaborates on Wood's analysis, stating that the Sawyer family's values ""reflect, or correspond to, established and interdependent American institutions ... but their embodiment of these social units is perverted and transgressive.""[149]

In Kim Newman's view, Hooper's presentation of the Sawyer family during the dinner scene parodies a typical American sitcom family: the gas station owner is the bread-winning father figure; the killer Leatherface is depicted as a bourgeois housewife; the hitchhiker acts as the rebellious teenager.[150] Isabel Cristina Pinedo, author of Recreational Terror: Women and the Pleasures of Horror Film Viewing, states, ""The horror genre must keep terror and comedy in tension if it is to successfully tread the thin line that separates it from terrorism and parody ... this delicate balance is struck in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which the decaying corpse of Grandpa not only incorporates horrific and humorous effects, but actually uses one to exacerbate the other.""[151]

Violence against women
The underlying themes of the film have been the subject of extensive critical discussion; critics and scholars have interpreted it as a paradigmatic exploitation film in which female protagonists are subjected to brutal, sadistic violence.[152][153] Stephen Prince comments that the horror is ""born of the torment of the young woman subjected to imprisonment and abuse amid decaying arms ... and mobiles made of human bones and teeth.""[154] As with many slasher films, it incorporates the ""final girl"" trope—the heroine and inevitable lone survivor who somehow escapes the horror that befalls the other characters:[155][156] Sally Hardesty is wounded and tortured, yet manages to survive with the help of a male truck driver.[157] Critics argue that even in exploitation films in which the ratio of male and female deaths is roughly equal, the images that linger will be of the violence committed against the female characters.[155][158][159] The specific case of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre provides support for this argument: three men are killed in quick fashion, but one woman is brutally slaughtered—hung on a meathook—and the surviving woman endures physical and mental torture.[160] In 1977, critic Mary Mackey described the meathook scene as probably the most brutal onscreen female death in any commercially distributed film.[161] She placed it in a lineage of violent films that depict women as weak and incapable of protecting themselves.[161]

In one study, a group of men were shown five films depicting differing levels of violence against women.[162] On first viewing The Texas Chain Saw Massacre they experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety; however, upon subsequent viewing they found the violence against women less offensive and more enjoyable.[160] Another study, investigating gender-specific perceptions of slasher films, involved 30 male and 30 female university students.[163] One male participant described the screaming, especially Sally's, as the ""most freaky thing"" in the film.[163]

According to Jesse Stommel of Bright Lights Film Journal, the lack of explicit violence in the film forces viewers to question their own fascination with violence that they play a central role in imagining.[164] Nonetheless—citing its feverish camera moves, repeated bursts of light, and auditory pandemonium—Stommel asserts that it involves the audience primarily on a sensory rather than an intellectual level.[164]

Vegetarianism
The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has been described as ""the ultimate pro-vegetarian film"" due to its animal rights themes. In a video essay, film critic Rob Ager describes the irony in humans' being slaughtered for meat, putting humans in the position of being slaughtered like farm animals. Director Tobe Hooper has confirmed that ""it's a film about meat""[165] and even gave up meat while making the film, saying, ""In a way I thought the heart of the film was about meat; it's about the chain of life and killing sentient beings.""[166][167] Writer-director Guillermo del Toro became a vegetarian for a time after seeing the film.[168]

Longlegs,2024,Osgood Perkins,M,Maika Monroe,F,"In pursuit of a serial killer, an FBI agent uncovers a series of occult clues that she must solve to end his terrifying killing spree.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longlegs,"In 1970s Oregon, a little girl with a Polaroid camera follows a mysterious voice and encounters an erratic man in pale makeup.

In the 1990s, FBI agent Lee Harker, who exhibits possible clairvoyance, is assigned to a case involving a series of murder-suicides in Oregon. Each case involves a father killing his family and himself, leaving behind a letter with Satanic coding signed ""Longlegs"", whose handwriting belongs to none of the family members. Lee discovers that each family had a 9-year-old daughter born on the 14th of the month, the murders all occurred within six days before or after the birthday itself, and the murders form an occult triangle symbol on a calendar, with one date missing. While talking to her mother Ruth, Lee receives a coded birthday card from Longlegs, warning her that revealing the source of the code will lead to her mother's murder.

Following a clue, Lee and her supervisor, Carter, find a doll with a high-energy orb inside. Despite Carter's skepticism of the supernatural, Lee theorizes that Longlegs uses these orbs to possess people as each family received a similar doll. After visiting the sole survivor of Longlegs's attacks, who was visited previously by someone using Lee's name, Carter suspects Lee's connection to Longlegs. Discovering that Ruth had filed a police report of an intruder approaching Lee on her 9th birthday, Carter encourages Lee to talk to Ruth, directing her to childhood belongings where she finds a Polaroid of the pale-faced man, revealing Longlegs to be the man who had visited a young Lee in the 1970s. Lee submits the photo, leading to Longlegs's arrest. Realizing the missing date is that day, Lee fears an accomplice. In the interrogation room, Longlegs claims to serve ""the man downstairs"" and hints at Ruth's involvement before killing himself.

Agent Browning drives Lee to her mother's home, where Lee witnesses Ruth murdering Browning with a shotgun. Ruth then destroys a doll resembling young Lee, causing Lee to lose consciousness. Lee sees that Ruth has been Longlegs's accomplice since Lee's childhood. Longlegs forced Ruth to choose between her daughter's life and his bidding, leading her to comply and spare Lee. Longlegs has lived in the Harker basement, creating Satanic dolls that Ruth, posing as a nun, delivered to families, causing them to kill each other. Lee's doll blocked her memories of Longlegs while influencing her with his magic.

Lee awakens in the basement and hears a demonic voice warning her about Carter's daughter Ruby's ninth birthday party, which had been scheduled for that day. Lee rushes to save the Carters, whose deaths would complete Longlegs's triangle. She finds the family already possessed, with Ruth having delivered the doll. After Carter kills his wife, Lee shoots him to protect Ruby. Ruth attacks with a dagger, forcing Lee to kill her. Lee tries to destroy the doll but runs out of ammunition and tells Ruby they need to leave, but Ruby remains frozen, staring at the doll.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth)**
   - This theme is evident through the character of Ruth, Lee's mother, who is coerced into a demonic pact to spare her daughter's life. The story delves into the extreme lengths a mother might go to protect her child, even if it leads to horrific outcomes.

2. **Possibly ""Female Sexuality (such as coming of age)""**
   - This theme is mild but present in the transition of Lee from a vulnerable child to an FBI agent dealing with her past traumas. The story indirectly touches on the vulnerable period of childhood and its impact on adult life.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

Lee Harker's role does not fit neatly into the traditional female roles listed. She is:

- **Other**
  - Lee serves as an FBI agent, a role that signifies authority and a non-traditional portrayal of femininity. Her professional role is oriented towards law enforcement and investigation rather than caretaking or beauty-related professions.

### Portrayal as a Monster:

- **Monstruous Feminine**
  - Ruth can be considered an example of the ""monstrous mother."" She collaborates with Longlegs, leading to horrific acts but all under a misguided attempt to protect her daughter.
  - Ruth's character fits the archetype where a mother becomes monstrous under the influence of supernatural forces, driven by her maternal instincts twisted into something horrific.
  - While Lee herself is not a monster, she deals with the monstrous acts committed by her mother, aligning with Barbara Creed's analysis of how the horror genre often manipulates maternal roles.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?

- **Survives**
  - Lee survives the events of the movie, taking action to stop the possessed Carter and protect Ruby, even though she faces numerous threats and personal losses.

### Focus of the Story:

- **Empowerment**
  - Despite facing extreme psychological and physical threats, Lee manages to unravel the mystery, confront her traumatic past, and take decisive action to try and save others, particularly Ruby. Her journey from a victim of past horrors to an active agent combating those same forces indicates a narrative geared towards empowerment. Lee gains agency and autonomy throughout the movie, showing resilience and strength in the face of terror.

Overall, ""Longlegs"" integrates themes of motherhood in a twisted and dark manner while empowering its female lead through her journey of confrontation and resolution against supernatural threats.",1,5,2,2,2,1

But when the doll's programming works too well, she becomes overprotective of her new friend with terrifying results.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3GAN,"After her parents are killed in a car accident, eight-year-old Cady is sent to live with her aunt Gemma, a roboticist at the high-tech Seattle toy company, Funki. Gemma is covertly using the company's resources to develop M3GAN (Model 3 Generative Android), a child-sized humanoid robot doll powered by artificial intelligence, designed to be the ultimate companion for children. During an unsuccessful test of M3GAN in their lab, Gemma's boss, David, discovers the project and orders her to discontinue work on it. Gemma and Cady struggle to connect until Cady comes across Bruce, a motion capture robot that Gemma had created at college. Watching Cady with Bruce, Gemma is motivated to complete M3GAN.

When the prototype M3GAN is formally paired with Cady, David is convinced of the project's potential for success. M3GAN exceeds expectations and begins to take on a parental role. Gemma's colleagues, Tess and Cole, as well as Cady's therapist, Lydia, become increasingly concerned about Cady developing an unhealthy emotional attachment to M3GAN. M3GAN starts operating more independently and targets anything that she deems a threat to Cady: she kills Dewey, the dog of Gemma's neighbor Celia, after it attacks both her and Cady while in the front yard. Later, M3GAN attacks Brandon, a boy bullying Cady, and pulls off his ear; when she chases him, he falls into the road and is run over by a passing car.

After Celia blames Gemma for Dewey's disappearance, M3GAN fatally sprays her with insecticide after shooting her with a nail gun. Gemma becomes suspicious of M3GAN and attempts to check her video logs, only to find the files corrupted or deleted. Gemma powers M3GAN off and brings her to the lab, where she, Tess, and Cole attempt to fix her. Cady becomes distraught when separated from M3GAN and slaps Gemma. Gemma apologizes for her inattentiveness and tells Cady that M3GAN is only a distraction that helps her cope with her loss, not a solution.

After watching M3GAN with Cady, Funki's investors greenlight M3GAN's release. Recognizing the risk she poses, Gemma, Tess, and Cole decide to terminate M3GAN. Tess and Cole attempt to shut M3GAN down while Gemma takes Cady home; M3GAN activates on her own and nearly hangs Cole. While Tess saves Cole, M3GAN causes an explosion in their lab, knocking them out. Before exiting the building, M3GAN kills David and his assistant Kurt in an elevator, staging it as a murder–suicide. She steals a car and drives back to Gemma's house.

M3GAN confronts Gemma, adamant about taking over as Cady's sole parent. Gemma attempts to stop M3GAN, damaging and disfiguring her in the process, but M3GAN ultimately overpowers her. Cady saves Gemma, using Bruce to tear M3GAN apart, but M3GAN's top half remains active and attacks Cady. Gemma exposes a processing chip in M3GAN's head, which Cady stabs with a screwdriver, seemingly destroying M3GAN. However, as Gemma and Cady exit the home, Gemma's AI home device turns on by itself, and a camera looks towards them.

She gets into her car and drives away. That night, she sits alone on a beach and calls her parents to tell them she loves them. In the morning, her mutilated corpse remains on the beach.

Carefree university student Jay Height goes to a movie with her boyfriend Hugh. Hugh points out a girl in a yellow dress, whom Jay says she cannot see. Unnerved, Hugh asks that they leave. Later, Hugh and Jay have sex for the first time in his car, after which he incapacitates her with chloroform. She wakes up tied to a wheelchair, where Hugh explains that he has passed something to her through intercourse - she will be pursued by an entity that only they can see, which can take the appearance of any person. It moves at a walking pace, but always knows where she is and will be approaching at all times. If it catches Jay, it will kill her and pursue the previous person to have passed it on. Hugh waits until a naked woman slowly approaches them to prove Jay is being followed, then urges her to have sex with someone else soon. He drives Jay home and flees. The next day, the police cannot find the naked woman or Hugh, who was living under a false identity.

At school, Jay sees an old woman walking towards her, invisible to others, and flees. Jay's sister Kelly and her longtime friends Paul and Yara spend the night at Jay's house. Someone smashes a window; Paul investigates but sees no one. Jay then sees a disheveled, urinating, half-naked woman walking toward her and runs upstairs to the others, who cannot see the entity.

Jay waits in the pool until the entity arrives with the appearance of her father. Instead of entering the pool, it throws the devices at her. Firing at an invisible target, Paul accidentally wounds Yara but shoots the entity twice before it falls into the pool.

To me, it's dream logic in the sense that they're in a nightmare, and when you're in a nightmare there's no solving the nightmare. Even if you try to solve it.""[12] Mitchell said that while Jay ""opens herself up to danger through sex, the one way in which she can free herself from that danger... We're all here for a limited amount of time and we can't escape our mortality... but love and sex are two ways in which we can at least temporarily push death away.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

She sternly instructs them not to remove their blindfolds, or they will die.

Five years earlier, a pregnant Malorie is visited by her sister, Jessica. A news broadcast reports unexplained mass suicides spreading across Europe and Asia. After a prenatal checkup, Malorie witnesses a woman smashing her head repeatedly into the hospital window. Others start acting suicidal as well, causing panic and chaos. Afterward, Malorie hurries to leave the scene with Jessica. While steering away from the hospital, Jessica sees something inexplicable that drives her insane and she deliberately crashes her car. She then walks in front of a speeding truck and is killed.

As Malorie flees on foot, a woman invites her into a house for safety. The woman then sees the entity before going into a trance and sitting inside a burning car. A passerby, Tom, picks up Malorie from the street into the house, where six other people – Douglas, Greg, Cheryl, Felix, Charlie, and Lucy – are taking shelter. Charlie says that humanity has been judged, and the appearance of demonic entities is a sign of the end times. He also mentions that those spiritual beings have different names in various cultures, such as Aka Manah, Surgat, Huli Jing, and Púca. Those in the house cover all the windows and blindfold themselves whenever they go out. As a new pregnant survivor, Olympia, arrives, Greg commits suicide after volunteering to test if it is safe to observe the entities indirectly through surveillance cameras.

Half of the group goes to the grocery store Charlie worked at to restock their dwindling food. They drive there in a car with covered windows using GPS navigation system. Malorie gets three pet birds along with their supplies. She notices the entities' presence agitates the birds. Later, Charlie's coworker attacks the group, attempting to force them to look at the creatures. However, Charlie sacrifices himself to save the others. They make it back to the house. Sometime after, Felix and Lucy steal the car and drive away.

Olympia lets a stranger named Gary into the house against Douglas's wishes. Gary explains he escaped from a group of unblindfolded survivors who have gone insane from seeing the entities and try to force others to look at them as well. Douglas tries to force Gary to leave, but Cheryl knocks Douglas out, and the others lock him in the garage. As Olympia and Malorie go into labor simultaneously, Gary works on drawings of the entities, revealing he has seen them too and gone insane. He knocks Tom unconscious and opens the garage door, exposing Douglas to the entities. Gary goes upstairs and rips all the windows' blinds. Olympia fails to look away, and after witnessing the creature, she dives out the window, killing herself. Malorie hides with both newborn babies under a cover while Gary forces Cheryl to look at the entities, causing her to stab herself in the neck with a pair of scissors. Douglas escapes the garage and blindly attempts to kill Gary with a shotgun, wounding him in the process, but Gary kills him with the scissors. Tom begins to recuperate shortly after, fighting Gary over the gun. After Malorie hears a few gunshots, Tom approaches her to say everything is fine.

Five years later, Tom and Malorie live together with the children, called ""Boy"" and ""Girl"". They receive transmissions from survivors informing them of a safe community hidden in the forest, accessible only by boat along the river. As they leave their house, a group of unblindfolded survivors attacks them. Tom distracts the assailants so Malorie and the children can flee. He uncovers his eyes and sees the entities, but manages to eliminate all the attackers before killing himself.

Malorie and the children go blindfolded down the river on a boat, carrying the birds to warn them of the entities. They encounter several obstacles, including an unblindfolded survivor and river rapids. Soon after the three reach shore, they are separated when Malorie accidentally slides down a hill. The entities nearly trick the kids into taking off their blindfolds. Malorie regains consciousness and tells the children that she loves them and where to find her. They eventually reach the community, a former school for the blind. Malorie releases the birds and finally gives the children names, Tom and Olympia, admitting that she is their mother.

Evil Dead Rise,2023,Lee Cronin,M,Lily Sullivan,F,Three siblings find an ancient vinyl that gives birth to bloodthirsty demons that run amok in a Los Angeles apartment building and thrusts them into a primal battle for survival as they face the most nightmarish version of family imaginable.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Dead_Rise,"Cousins Teresa and Jessica, and Jessica's boyfriend Caleb, are vacationing at a lakeside cabin when a seemingly sick Jessica scalps Teresa and decapitates Caleb before levitating above the lake.

One day earlier, upset at learning she is pregnant, guitar technician Beth visits her sister Ellie, a tattoo artist and single mother to teenagers Danny and Bridget, and child Kassie, in their home at Monde Apartments, a condemned Los Angeles apartment complex. The building is shaken by an earthquake while the children are in its basement parking lot, uncovering a concealed chamber. Danny investigates it, discovering religious artifacts, three phonograph records from 1923, and a strange book that he takes up to his room, believing he could possibly sell it and use the money to help Ellie. The initial record details rejected efforts by a priest to research the book, revealed to be one of three volumes of the Naturom Demonto. The subsequent record reveals the priest continued his research in secret and recites an incantation that summons demonic entities known as Deadites.

The building's power fails and Ellie is possessed by an unseen force. She returns to the apartment in a trance, menacingly threatens her family, and dies after pleading with Beth to protect her children. Ellie's neighbours help lay her to rest in her bedroom and search for a way out. They find that the staircase has collapsed, the elevator is damaged, and they are unable to access the fire escape before Ellie revives and attacks the family, wounding Beth and Bridget. Beth and the children lock Ellie outside the apartment after she pursues and massacres the neighbors.

Danny confesses to Beth about recovering the Naturom Demonto, and Ellie tricks Kassie into unlocking the door before attacking her. While Danny and Beth are distracted rescuing Kassie and locking Ellie out, Bridget becomes possessed from her wound. Bridget attacks Beth before turning on Danny and Kassie, who inadvertently impales her through the head with a broken broom handle.

Beth listens to the third record to understand how to exorcise the Deadites, but learns the priest failed and his allies were all possessed, with only complete destruction of the host stopping the Deadites. Bridget revives and fatally stabs Danny, who sets Bridget on fire before dying as Ellie infiltrates the apartment using the vents. Realizing Beth is pregnant, Ellie attempts to rip the fetus out of her, but Beth and Kassie are able to incapacitate her with scissors. Ellie fails to emotionally manipulate Kassie, who accepts the fact that her mother is gone.

Danny and the bodies of the neighbors are possessed, leading Beth and Kassie to take shelter in the damaged elevator. Ellie, Bridget, and Danny merge into a multi-limbed creature known as the Marauder[6] and climb atop the elevator to attack the pair as the elevator fills with blood. The combined weight causes the elevator to plummet to the ground floor, allowing Beth and Kassie to flee into the parking lot. The Marauder captures Kassie and attempts to behead her with a chainsaw, but Beth returns and distracts it, and she and Kassie destroy the Marauder's body by forcing it into a wood chipper. Ellie's severed head taunts Beth, saying she will be a failure as a mother, prompting her to kick Ellie's head into the chipper. Beth and Kassie escape the building together.

Suspiria,1977,Dario Argento,M,Jessica Harper,F,"From the moment she arrives in Freiberg, Germany, to attend the prestigious Tanz Academy, American ballet-dancer Suzy Bannion senses that something horribly evil lurks within the walls of the age-old institution.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspiria,"Suzy Bannion, a young American ballet student, arrives in Freiburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany during a torrential downpour to study at the co-ed Tanz Akademie, a prestigious German dance school. She sees another student, Pat Hingle, flee the school in terror. Suzy is refused entry to the school and forced to stay in town overnight. Pat takes refuge at a friend's apartment and tells her that something sinister happened at the school. Pat is ambushed by a shadowy figure who stabs her repeatedly and drags her to the roof of the apartment building before hanging her with a noose by throwing her through the building's skylight. Pat's friend is also killed after being impaled by a falling giant shard of glass while trying to alert other tenants to the murder.

Suzy returns to the school the next morning, where she meets Miss Tanner, the head instructor, and Madame Blanc, the deputy headmistress. Tanner introduces Suzy to Pavlos, one of the school's servants. She also meets classmates Sara and Olga, her new roommate. Suzy experiences an unsettling encounter with one of the school's matrons and Blanc's nephew, Albert, before passing out during a dance class. When she regains consciousness, Suzy learns that Olga has thrown her out of her apartment, forcing her to live at the school with Sara in the room next door.

While the students are preparing for supper one night, maggots rain down from the ceilings of their rooms due to a shipment of spoiled food in the attic, forcing them to sleep in one of the dance studios. During the night, a woman enters the room but is obscured by a curtain hung around the room's perimeter. Sara, frightened by her hoarse and labored breathing, recognizes her as the school's headmistress, who is supposedly out of town. The next day, the school's blind pianist, Daniel, is abruptly fired by Miss Tanner when his German Shepherd bites Albert. Daniel is stalked by an unseen force while walking through a plaza that night; his dog turns on him and viciously rips out his throat.

Sara tells Suzy that she was the one on the intercom who refused her entry the night Pat was murdered. She reveals that Pat was behaving strangely before her death and promises to show Suzy the notes that she left behind. Sara finds that Pat's notes are missing and is forced to flee when an unseen assailant enters the room. They pursue her through the school before cornering her in the attic. She escapes through a small window before falling into a pit of razor wire, entangling her and allowing her pursuer to kill her by slashing her throat.

Suzy investigates Sara's disappearance the next morning. Tanner tells her that Sara has fled the school. Suspicious, Suzy contacts Sara's friend and former psychiatrist, Frank Mandel. He reveals that the school was established by Greek émigrée Helena Markos in 1895, who was allegedly a witch. Suzy also consults with Professor Milius, a professor of the occult. He reveals that a coven of witches perishes without their leader, from whom they draw power.

When Suzy returns to the school, she finds that everyone has left to attend the Bolshoi Ballet. After being attacked by a bat and recalling a conversation with Sara about footsteps, she follows the sound of them carefully, leading her to Madame Blanc's office. Remembering that Pat uttered the words secret and iris the night that she was killed, Suzy discovers a hidden door that opens by turning a blue iris on a mural in Blanc's office. Suzy enters the corridor and finds the academy's instructors, led by Madame Blanc, plotting her demise in the form of a human sacrifice. Albert alerts Pavlos to Suzy's presence. Suzy hides in an alcove, where she finds Sara's disfigured corpse.

Pursued by Pavlos, Suzy retreats to Helena Markos's bedroom. Suzy finds Markos sleeping, recognizing her as the headmistress by her labored breathing. She accidentally wakes her by breaking a decorative peacock with crystal plumage. Markos renders herself invisible and taunts Suzy before reanimating Sara's mutilated corpse to murder her. When flashes of lightning inadvertently reveal Markos's silhouette, Suzy impales her through the neck with one of the peacock's broken glass quills. Markos's death causes Sara's corpse to vanish.

Suzy flees as the school starts to implode. Madame Blanc, Miss Tanner, Pavlos and the rest of the coven perish without the power of Markos to sustain them. Suzy escapes into the rainy night as the school is consumed by fire.

Suspiria,2018,Luca Guadagnino,M,Dakota Johnson,F,"A darkness swirls at the center of a world-renowned dance company, one that will engulf the troupe's artistic director, an ambitious young dancer and a grieving psychotherapist. Some will succumb to the nightmare, others will finally wake up.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspiria_(2018_film),"During the German Autumn of 1977, Susie Bannion, an American from a Mennonite family in Ohio, is admitted at the Markos Dance Academy in West Berlin. The academy is reeling from the disappearance of a student, Patricia Hingle, who vanished after telling her psychotherapist, Josef Klemperer, that the academy is controlled by a coven. Journals left by Patricia in Klemperer's office detail The Three Mothers, a trio of witches who predate Christianity: Mater Suspiriorum, Mater Tenebrarum, and Mater Lachrymarum. Klemperer, initially dismissive of Patricia's claims, becomes suspicious of the academy after her disappearance.

During rehearsal, a Soviet student, Olga, becomes indignant towards Madame Blanc, and storms out of the studio. Olga attempts to escape with her belongings, but finds herself trapped alone in a room lined with mirrors. Blanc, meanwhile, resumes the rehearsal, during which Susie performs an aggressive dance; her movements begin physically inflicting Olga, ravaging her body and damaging her organs and bones. Several of the academy's matrons drag Olga's mangled body away with large hooks. Later, the matrons hold an informal election for who is to serve as the coven's new leader. The vote is between Madame Blanc and Mother Markos, an aged and grossly disfigured witch who has long controlled the coven, and for whom the academy is named; Markos wins the popular vote. Afterwards, Miss Griffith, the most sheepish of the matrons, kills herself.

Susie befriends her classmate Sara, where one another investigate the disappearances of Olga and Patricia: both find out the academy has washed all traces of them. Susie quickly climbs the ranks as Blanc's protégée, then appointed the lead of the academy's upcoming piece, Volk. Meanwhile, Sara grows suspicious of the matrons after a meeting with Klemperer and uncovers clandestine hallways in the building where she discovers esoteric relics. Klemperer attends the performance. Immediately prior, Sara explores a passageway leading into catacombs where she finds a heavily withering Patricia. Sara runs away but the matrons manifest holes in the floor, causing her to fall and fracture her leg. Sara emerges midway through the performance, dancing her part in a hypnotic trance, but collapses in pain before the dance ends. Blanc subsequently chastises Susie for intervening in the matrons' efforts to manipulate Sara's body.

The next day, Susie attends a celebratory dinner with the matrons. Meanwhile, Klemperer encounters Anke, his presumed-deceased wife, at his dacha in East Germany. She tells him she faked her death after fleeing the Nazis and started a new life in England. They walk together, passing through a security checkpoint into West Berlin without being noticed. Klemperer realizes the two have arrived at the Markos Academy; before his eyes, he realizes Anke is, in fact, Miss Huller, one of the matrons, and that he has been lured there to bear witness to an impending witches' sabbath.

After the dinner, Susie returns to the academy and is led to a chamber where Blanc and the other matrons await with Mother Markos, whom Susie is to be a new vessel for, and an incapacitated Klemperer. Susie renounces her own mother, who simultaneously succumbs on her deathbed in Ohio. The matrons disembowel Sara to begin the sabbath, but Blanc senses a discrepancy. Hesitant to proceed, she is nearly decapitated by Markos. As Blanc bleeds profusely, Susie reveals that she, not Markos, is Mother Suspiriorum; she is there to claim the academy and eradicate Markos. Susie summons Death, killing Markos and her most faithful matrons, sparing only those devoted to Blanc. Patricia, Olga, and Sara, each physically ravaged, plead to die, which Susie grants them.

The following day, the academy resumes operations as usual. Miss Vendegast discovers Blanc on the verge of death, and an announcement is made to the students that Blanc has left the academy. Meanwhile, Klemperer, who was spared and now confined to his bed, is met by Susie at his home. She apologises for her coven's actions and recounts to him the fate of Anke, who died at the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Upon her touching him, he suffers a violent seizure that erases his memories before she leaves. In the present day, a carving of Klemperer and Anke's initials on the wall of their dacha goes unnoticed by its current occupants. In a post-credits scene, Susie stares approvingly at something outside the academy.

","Motherhood
The theme of motherhood is explored frequently in the film, both within the coven and in Susie's early life and relationship to her own mother.[4] Michael Leader of Sight & Sound considers the film ""an extended exercise in metafictional annotation that insists on dragging the original's darkest metaphors into the light.""[5]

Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post links the film's theme of motherhood (characterized alongside its ""discontents"" as being ""chewed on like a vulture tearing at a carrion"") with ethnic nationalism, though he states that ""neither subtext goes much of anywhere"".[6] Julie Bloom echoed similar sentiments in The New York Times, writing that while the film ""revels in gore and gruesome displays of horror...  it also delves into the dynamics of a wholly female community, touching on issues of power, manipulation, motherhood and the horrible things some women can do to other women and themselves.""[7]

Matt Goldberg of Collider interprets a perfidious form of motherhood as a core theme of the film, as he notes the matrons merely pretend ""to be motherly towards the students, [but] they're actually just using them for their power.""[8] Madame Blanc's near-decapitation at the hands of Mother Markos when she is resistant to beginning the sabbath demonstrates that Blanc and Markos ""do not share the same values"", and that Blanc has formed a genuine kinship with Susie.[8] Hannah Ewens of Vice notes: ""With coven power transferred to Susie, it's impossible to say where her talent ends and the influence of the mothers begins. Mothers aren't supposed to have favorites, but deep down they often do—and Madame Blanc's is Susie from the moment of her audition.""[9]

Abuse of power and national guilt
For the majority of the film, Susie appears to be an otherwise normal woman who finds her natural talents rewarded and prized by the coven.[8] As the film progresses into its final act, however, it is revealed that Susie is in fact Mother Suspiriorum, one of the Three Mothers whom the coven exalts.[8] Film Crit Hulk, a pseudonymous writer for The New York Observer, interprets Susie's character arc as the discovery of her shadow self: ""Initially she seems just a fresh-faced girl from Ohio, eager to make strides into this esteemed dance company. But her shadow self is soon awoken, which we are meant to fear. Susie unleashes her libido as the rapturous demon below claws at the floor. She turns deeply sexual, almost becoming carnal as she writhes to the ground.""[10] Similarly to Goldberg, they interpret Susie's unveiling of herself as Mother Suspiriorium to be messianic in nature, as she eradicates the corrupted Mother Markos and the loyal followers who idolize her.[10] Goldberg reads Susie's destruction of Markos and her followers as retribution for their abuse of power:

Guadagnino is repeatedly hitting on a world where power has been abused, and those who feel no guilt or shame are running rampant. We see it in Klemperer's history as a Holocaust survivor; we see it in the current events that pop up in the news during the movie; and we see it inside the coven where the older women who are supposed to be teaching and helping the students are instead preying on them. The movie isn't saying that powerful women are bad; it's saying that anyone who abuses their power to their own ends rather than serving others is perverting that power.[8]


The historical events surrounding the Red Army Faction and Vergangenheitsbewältigung serve as the backdrop for the film's themes of corruption within the coven.
(pictured: Dutch RAF supporters, 1974)
While Susie/Mother Suspiriorum shows no mercy for Markos and her followers, Goldberg asserts that she is capable of compassion, citing the fact that she grants the physically devastated Sara, Olga, and Patricia ""the sweet release of a gentle death rather than obliterating them.""[8] Goldberg extends this interpretation to Susie/Mother Suspiriorum's visit to Klemperer in the epilogue, during which she relates his lost wife's death in a concentration camp, information he had not previously known.[8] Goldberg reads the sequence as an emphasis that ""women bonding together have the power to remove the fear of death, and that while the world—especially the powerful—need 'guilt' and 'shame,' Klemperer should not feel those things because he has not abused his power. He's the ""witness"" and from the perspective of witnessing an authoritarian rise to power—in his case, Nazi Germany—he is responsible for watching and doing nothing. However, it's people in power who need guilt and shame.""[8]

Some critics have alternately interpreted the representation of the coven's power as inspiring fear of women's autonomy and linking it solely with violence.[11][12] Sonia Rao of The Washington Post notes that while ""Guadagnino grants these women power"", their power ""knows no bounds. Madam Blanc...  can turn Susie's dreams into bloodcurdling nightmares. She and the other matrons can inflict injuries on dancers whenever and wherever they want. The witches frequently inflict or inspire violence—their actions, after all, are what make this a horror movie. But some critics say this makes it seem like a woman with a great amount of power is someone who should be feared.""[12] The Chicago Reader's Andrea Thompson echoes this sentiment, writing that the film adopts a vision where ""when women are united, it is always to achieve an evil outcome.""[13] Andrew Whalen of Newsweek conversely suggests that the film ""decimat[es] typical narrative conventions of good and bad...  Evil is disturbingly natural in Suspiria, where sometimes only further violence can make room for good to exist at all.""[14] Whalen characterizes the coven as ""a working alternative to the patriarchy falling apart outside [the] doors—financially autonomous, beyond the reach of the police...  and deeply, powerfully collectivist, both materially and spiritually.""[14]

The narrative of the coven and Susie/Mother Suspiriorum's infiltration of it is underpinned by numerous historical incidents, including the hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181, bombings, and numerous kidnappings perpetrated by the Red Army Faction, a Marxist group whose peak activity occurred in the autumn of 1977 in West Germany.[15] These events occurred in the wake of Vergangenheitsbewältigung, a period referring to Germany's national reflection on their culpability in World War II and the Holocaust,[16] which ""echoes constantly throughout"" the film.[17] While Goldberg[8] has pointed out correlations between the coven's innerworkings and the national events occurring outside of it, others, such as Simon Abrams of The Hollywood Reporter, view them as ""surface-level parallels between historic signifiers"" that ""have the odd effect of subordinating those female-centered themes to a blandly familiar grab bag of sensationalistic headlines.""[18] Abrams concludes that the film offers ""an underdeveloped, pseudo-Jungian understanding of how historical events kinda/sorta overshadow their protagonists' lives.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: The theme of motherhood is explored extensively within the film, from Susie's early life and relationship with her own mother to the coven's motherly facade which is actually a deceitful form of control and manipulation.
2. **Female Sexuality**: Susie's character arc reveals her journey from a seemingly naive girl to Mother Suspiriorum, unveiling her shadow self. This transformation is deeply sexual and carnal, illustrating an awakening of her libido.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
1. **Professional Role Related to Beauty or Perfection**: Susie Bannion is a dancer at the Markos Dance Academy, which places her in a role related to beauty, grace, and perfection within the realm of artistic performance.
   
### Portrayal as a Monster
1. **Monstrous Feminine**: By the end of the film, Susie reveals herself as Mother Suspiriorum, one of the Three Mothers, which aligns with Barbara Creed's concept of the ""monstrous feminine."" She embodies the archaic mother and the castrator, given her role in eradicating Mother Markos and her twisted followers.

### Survival of the Female Protagonist
1. **Survives**: Susie does not die; instead, she assumes her rightful place as Mother Suspiriorum and takes control of the coven.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
1. **Empowerment**: Despite being subjected to control and manipulation by the coven initially, Susie ultimately gains autonomy and takes control over her own narrative and the story's outcome. She eradicates the corrupted leadership and takes on a powerful role, indicating a significant arc of female empowerment.",1,3,1,2,2,1
The Cabin in the Woods,2011,Drew Goddard,M,Kristen Connolly,F,"Five college friends spend the weekend at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for. Together, they must discover the truth behind the cabin in the woods.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cabin_in_the_Woods,"In an underground laboratory, engineers Gary Sitterson and Steve Hadley discuss a mysterious ritual, after a similar operation in Stockholm just ended in failure, leaving only their facility and one in Japan to undertake the process, and with the latter holding a perfect record.

American college students Dana Polk, Jules Louden, Curt Vaughan, Holden McCrea, and Marty Mikalski are spending their weekend at Curt's cousin's cabin in the woods. From the lab, Sitterson and Hadley remotely control the cabin and manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs. In the cabin's cellar, the group finds bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the diary and inadvertently summons the zombified Buckner family.

Hadley releases pheromones to induce Curt and Jules to have sex outside. They are attacked by the zombies and Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes. Marty discovers concealed surveillance equipment in his room before being stabbed and dragged off by a zombie. The lab workers learn that the site in Japan has also failed, meaning that the American rite is ""humanity's last hope"". Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their RV, but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt attempts to jump a ravine on his motorcycle to seek help on the other side, but crashes into a force field and falls to his death. Dana then realizes that their experience is staged and controlled. Holden is killed by a zombie while driving the RV, causing it to crash into the lake, but Dana manages to escape.

The lab employees, seeing that Dana is the only survivor, celebrate the success of the rite, but then discover Marty is still alive. Marty takes Dana to a hidden elevator he discovered. They descend into the lab and discover a large collection of different monsters in cages. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cabin's cellar and realizes that the objects determine which monsters are released. Cornered by security personnel, the pair release all the monsters, which wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed while Dana accidentally stabs Sitterson.

Dana and Marty discover an ancient temple, where they are confronted by ""The Director"". She explains that worldwide annual rituals of human sacrifice are held to appease the Ancient Ones, a group of cruel subterranean deities. Each region has its own ritual, and the American ritual involves the sacrifice of five archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). The order is arbitrary as long as the whore dies first and the virgin dies last or survives. The Director urges Dana to kill Marty to complete the ritual, as all other rituals failed that year. Dana is attacked by a werewolf, while Patience kills The Director; Marty proceeds to kill all except Dana.

Deciding that humanity is not worth saving, Dana and Marty share a joint. The temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges from the ground, destroying the facility and the cabin.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Motherhood:** Not clearly related to motherhood, pregnancy, or childbirth.
2. **Gender-based violence:** The manipulation and sacrifice of the characters, including the female lead, can be construed as a form of violence, although it is not exclusively gender-based.
3. **Female sexuality:** Jules represents the ""whore"" archetype and her induced sexual acts leading to her death fall under this category.
4. **Beauty, perfection, or aging:** Not clearly related.
5. **Other:** The main theme is the sacrifice of archetypes to appease ancient deities. This ritualistic sacrifice includes a female virgin archetype, which fits into a broader narrative of ritualistic violence and the manipulation of young women.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

- **Professional related to caretaking (such as nun, nurse, teacher):** Dana Polk is an archetypal ""virgin"" character, a role traditionally emphasizing innocence and virtue, and she does not fit categories like mother/housewife or professional roles related to beauty.
- **Other:** As a college student, she does not fit neatly into the traditional categorical roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness.

### Monstruous Feminine

- **Other:** Dana is not portrayed as a monstrous feminine. She represents the archetypal ""virgin"" and survives till the end.
   
### Fate of the Female Protagonist

- **Dies:** Dana dies when the giant hand emerges from the ground, destroying the facility and the cabin.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment

- **Victimization:** The story primarily focuses on the characters being manipulated and sacrificed, with Dana struggling to survive. Although she uncovers the truth and attempts to resist, she cannot escape her fate, making it more about immediate survival and victimization rather than empowerment.

In summary, ""The Cabin in the Woods"" portrays themes related to gender-based violence and a broader narrative of ritualistic violence. Dana Polk, the main protagonist, adheres to the ""virgin"" archetype but does not fit the monstrous feminine trope. She succumbs to her fate, and the movie ultimately centers around victimization rather than empowerment.",5,5,2,1,2,1
The Blair Witch Project,1999,Daniel Myrick,M,Heather Donahue,F,"In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary.

In October 1994, film students Heather, Mike, and Josh set out to produce a documentary about the mythical Blair Witch. They travel to Burkittsville, Maryland, and interview residents about the myth. Locals tell them of Rustin Parr, a hermit who lived deep in the forest and abducted 7 children in 1941; he murdered them all in his basement, killing them in pairs while having one stand in a corner. The students explore the forest in north Burkittsville to research the myth. They meet 2 fishermen, one of whom warns them that the forest is cursed. He tells them of a young child named Robin Weaver, who went missing in 1888; when she returned 3 days later, she talked about an old woman whose feet never touched the ground. The students hike to Coffin Rock, where 5 men were found ritualistically slaughtered in the 19th century; their corpses later disappeared.

They camp for the night and, the next day, find an old graveyard with 7 small cairns, one of which Josh accidentally knocks over. That night, they hear the sound of sticks snapping. The following day, they try to hike back to the car but cannot find it before dark and make camp. They again hear sticks snapping. In the morning, they find 3 cairns built beside their tent. Heather learns her map is missing. Mike reveals he kicked the map into a creek out of frustration, which provokes a fight between the trio as they realize they are lost. They head south, using Heather's compass, and discover stick figures hanging from trees. They again hear mysterious sounds that night, including children laughing. After an unknown force shakes the tent, they hide in the forest until dawn.

Upon returning to their tent, they find their possessions have been rifled, and Josh's equipment is covered with slime. They come across a river identical to the one they crossed earlier and realize they have been walking in circles. Josh vanishes the next morning, and Heather and Mike try vainly to find him. That night, they hear Josh's agonized cries but are unable to find him. They theorize that his yells are a fabrication by the Blair Witch to draw them out of their camp.

Heather discovers a bundle of twigs tied with fabric from Josh's shirt the next day. Upon opening the bundle, she finds a blood-soaked scrap of his shirt containing a tongue, a finger, some teeth, and hair. Although distraught, she does not tell Mike. That night, she records herself apologizing to her, Mike's, and Josh's families, taking responsibility for their predicament. She admits that something evil is haunting them and will ultimately take them.

That night, they hear Josh calling out to them and follow his voice to the abandoned ruins of the house of Rustin Parr, featuring demonic symbols and children's bloody handprints on the walls. Trying to locate Josh, they go to the basement, where an unseen force assaults Mike, causing him to drop his camera. Heather enters the basement yelling, and her camera captures Mike standing in a corner facing the wall. Heather calls out to him, but he does not react. The unseen force assaults Heather, causing her to scream and drop her camera.

Fresh,2022,Mimi Cave,F,Daisy Edgar-Jones,F,"Frustrated by scrolling dating apps only to end up on lame, tedious dates, Noa takes a chance by giving her number to the awkwardly charming Steve after a produce-section meet-cute at the grocery store.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_(2022_film),"Noa, a woman from Portland, is increasingly disillusioned with online dating and the rude men she interacts with. One day at the supermarket, a man named Steve flirts with her and they exchange numbers. On their first date, the two quickly hit it off and have sex. After several dates, Steve invites Noa for a weekend break away alone with him. Against the advice of her best friend Mollie, Noa agrees to the trip. Planning to travel early the following day, Noa spends the evening at Steve's luxury home. Steve drugs Noa's cocktail and she falls unconscious.

Noa wakes up in captivity, chained to the ground. Steve explains that he is a butcher of human meat, which he both consumes himself and sells to wealthy clients, revealing himself as a sadistic cannibal. His clients prefer the meat of young women, so he regularly lures and abducts women on dates. He says that he will keep Noa alive as long as possible in order to keep her meat fresh as he intends to surgically remove different pieces of her body over time. Noa speaks to a woman named Penny who is being held captive in an adjacent room. Penny shares with Noa that a woman that can be heard singing incoherently is another victim named Melissa who has gone insane. When Steve allows Noa to take a shower, she tries to escape. Steve captures her and harvests her buttocks as punishment.

Meanwhile, Mollie becomes concerned about Noa's disappearance and begins investigating with her friend Paul, a bartender who served Noa and Steve drinks on their first date. After searching online, Mollie discovers Steve is actually named Brendan, and is married to a woman named Ann with whom he has children. Mollie visits Ann and informs her of Brendan’s apparent affair. Brendan arrives, but denies any knowledge of Noa when questioned by Mollie. As she leaves, Mollie calls Noa's phone, which begins ringing in Brendan's pocket. Ann, realizing he's been caught, knocks Mollie unconscious. In a shower scene, it is revealed that Ann has a prosthetic leg, implying that she might have been one of Brendan's past victims.

Noa gains Brendan's trust by flirting and pretending to be interested in what human meat tastes like. Brendan invites her to dinner and persuades her to taste a lavish meal containing human meat, which Noa eats and pretends to enjoy, but later vomits in her cell. Meanwhile, Brendan takes Mollie away for harvesting. Brendan invites Noa to another dinner, providing her with a pink dress as a gift. Before dinner, Brendan shows Noa a hidden compartment filled with items belonging to his victims, indicating he has abducted and murdered dozens of women before her. While observing Brendan's trophies, Noa recognizes Mollie's phone amongst those of the kidnapped victims. At dinner, he feeds Noa breast meat, which Brendan connotes as possibly tasting ""familiar."" Following dinner, Noa persuades Brendan to have sex with her and let her perform fellatio on him; she instead bites off his penis. With Brendan injured, but in pursuit, Noa helps Mollie and Penny escape from their rooms. The three encounter Brendan in the kitchen and fight him, then escape into the woods with Brendan pursuing them with a gun.

In the meantime, before she was abducted, Mollie had shared her location via phone with Paul. When he does not hear back from Mollie, Paul follows the location and arrives at Brendan's house. However, hearing gunshots fired by Brendan, Paul turns away fearing for his life.

In the woods, Noa, Mollie, and Penny manage to attack him again, with Noa taking the gun and shooting Brendan dead. Ann arrives at the house and finds Brendan's body. She encounters Noa in the woods and tries to strangle her, but Noa stabs Ann in the neck with car keys. As Ann recovers and attempts to strangle Noa again, Mollie bludgeons Ann to death with a shovel. As she and Mollie relax at last, Noa receives a text from a man she went out with at the beginning of the film.

Aliens,1986,James Cameron,M,Sigourney Weaver,F,"When Ripley's lifepod is found by a salvage crew over 50 years later, she finds that terra-formers are on the very planet they found the alien species. When the company sends a family of colonists out to investigate her story—all contact is lost with the planet and colonists. They enlist Ripley and the colonial marines to return and search for answers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film),"Ellen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years aboard an escape shuttle after destroying her ship, the Nostromo, to escape an alien creature that slaughtered the rest of the crew.[i] She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426,[ii] since it is now the site of a terraforming colony.

After contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship Sulaco but is distrustful of their android, Bishop, because the android aboard the Nostromo betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.

A dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks, but no bodies or colonists except for a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the colonists beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station center, the Marines find opened eggs and dead facehuggers alongside the cocooned colonists now serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an infant alien after it bursts from a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the Marines and kill or capture many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, takes control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, and it crashes into the station. Almost out of ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony.

Ripley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose him, Bishop informs the group that the dropship crash damaged the power-plant cooling system and the plant will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. He volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface.

After falling asleep in the medical laboratory, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the Marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos, allowing him to smuggle them through Earth's quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson, and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley brings Hicks to Bishop in the second dropship, but she refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen surrounded by dozens of eggs, and when one begins to open, Ripley uses her weapons to destroy them all and the queen's ovipositor. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt join Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast.

Aboard the Sulaco, the group is ambushed by the queen, who stowed away in the dropship's landing gear. The queen tears Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley fights the creature with an exosuit cargo loader and expels it through an airlock into space while the damaged Bishop keeps Newt safe. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.","Motherhood
A central theme of Aliens is motherhood.[32][177] Alien can be seen as a metaphor for childbirth, but Aliens focuses on Ripley's maternal feelings for Newt. A scene cut from the theatrical release depicts Ripley learning her child died while she was in stasis, helping explain Ripley's motherly attention for Newt. Newt has also lost everything of value, and they form a new family from the remnants of their old ones.[129][177] This relationship is mirrored by the alien queen, mother of the alien creatures.[177][178] There are no paternal figures; both are single mothers, defending their young. The alien queen seeks revenge against Ripley, who destroyed her brood and her means of reproduction.[119][177] According to Richard Schickel, Alien is about survival; Aliens is about fighting to ensure someone else's survival.[129]

Authors Tammy Ostrander and Susan Yunis believed Newt's capture by the aliens forces Ripley to realize she is willing to die to save her, demonstrating a selfless motherhood, unlike the queen's selfish motherhood.[179] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Nancy Weber wrote that as a mother, she saw in Aliens the constant vigilance required to protect her child from predators, sexism, and threats to childhood innocence.[180] Leilani Nishime believed despite the focus on motherhood, the nuclear family is represented in Aliens with a mother (Ripley), father (Hicks), daughter (Newt), and a loyal, self-sacrificing dog (Bishop).[181]

According to Charles Berg, the depictions of aliens in science fiction that became more popular during the 1980s represented American fears of immigrants (the ""other""). In Aliens, this can be seen in the white-skinned single mother (Ripley) confronting the dark-skinned alien queen with an endless brood.[182] Ostrander and Yunis also identified fears of overcrowding, dwindling resources, and pollution, suggesting the alien queen demonizes motherhood and makes it less attractive. She represents mindless, unchecked maternal instinct spawning armies of children, regardless of the lives which must be sacrificed to ensure their survival. Despite imminent destruction by the colony exploding, the queen continues to reproduce.[183] The aliens' life cycle taints the reproductive cycle. Creation involves rape, and birth involves a violent death.[184] In destroying the aliens and their queen, Ripley rejects the unchecked proliferation of their species and sets an example for her own.[185]

Masculinity and femininity
Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, holding a gun
Ripley was often compared to the era's masculine heroes, including Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo.
Ripley has been compared to John Rambo and dubbed Ramboette, Rambette, Fembo, Ramboline; Weaver called herself Rambolina.[33][186][187] Mary Lee Settle said females in television and film had evolved from escapist fantasy to more accurately reflect their audiences. A gun, which can be seen as a phallic symbol, has a different meaning when wielded by Weaver.[186] Schickel described Ripley as transcending the customary boundaries imposed on her gender, where females serve the male hero. In Aliens, the male characters are neutralized by the climax and Ripley faces the queen alone.[26] Cameron said he does not like cowardly female characters and removes their expected protectors to force them to fend for themselves. He called the overuse of male heroes ""commercially shortsighted"" in an industry whose audience is 50-percent female, and where ""80 percent of the time, it's women who decide which film to see"".[26][28]

The growth of female-led action films after the success of Aliens reflects the change in women's roles and the divide between professional critics (who perceive a masculinization of the heroine) and audiences that—regardless of gender—embrace, emulate, and quote Ripley.[188] The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced by independent women capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).[189] These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine ""soft"" bodies.[190] When Ripley has seized command of the marines and is no longer a passive outsider in Aliens, the traditional male hero (Hicks) instructs her in the use of their weapons.[191] The comparison of Ripley to Rambo conflates her with the male, musclebound, gun-wielding action hero.[192] To balance her masculine traits, Cameron gives Ripley maternal instincts; this counters homophobic audiences, who might see a masculinized female as lesbian or butch.[193] These traits are further offset by the more openly masculine Vasquez, a minor character. Vasquez (who has short hair and bigger muscles) is introduced to the audience by working out, and is asked if she has ever been mistaken for a man.[194] Weber appreciated the change in female characters between the films, contrasting Alien's hysterical Lambert with the tough Vasquez (who sacrifices herself for her team, not only for the protagonist).[180]

War and trauma
Aliens has been described as an allegory for the Vietnam War; the marines (like the United States) have superior weaponry and technology that proves largely ineffective against an unseen, local enemy.[28][85] Like some Vietnam veterans, Ripley developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the events of Alien.[195] Writer Joe Abbott contrasted the depiction of the military in Aliens to the 1954 science-fiction film Them! In both films, humans are beset by a monstrous invasion; in Them!, the military is the hero despite its responsibility for the infestation. Abbott said its post-World War II American setting depicts a competent military and a state authority that demands (and receives) the compliance of its citizens. The image of the post-Vietnam military is tarnished and scrutinized; in Aliens, it is ill-equipped, bumbling, and incapable of combating the threat posed by the alien creatures. Citizen cooperation can no longer be demanded or expected, and it is Ripley, an independent contractor from outside the state and military infrastructures, who saves the day.[196] Unlike Them!, the military is not at fault for creating the problem in Aliens; it is the Weyland-Yutani corporation (""the company"") . The power of the state has been superseded by the corporation, which also demands conformity for rewards and advancement and reflects a growing mistrust of corporatism; the company is represented by Burke, a self-interested opportunist.[197] Ripley is elevated throughout Aliens as she prioritizes the survival and safety of all humans while Burke often is often willing to callously sacrifice human life in pursuit of the interests of the company.[198]

According to Weaver, Aliens is about confronting trauma to obtain closure.[199] This may be seen as a reflection of Ronald Reagan's United States presidency and a conservatism that believed the hero must return to confront their fears with ethics and morality on their side.[200][201] Comparing Alien with Aliens, Roger Luckhurst said: ""Even if Alien was a piece of leftist science fiction, the core of [its] myth could be inflected the other way. [Cameron's] Aliens would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story—pumped, militarized, libertarian driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family.""[202] Abbott said Aliens adheres to a radical ideology and condemns centrism; similar films were popular because they represented audience dissatisfaction with the social status quo.[196] The film places power in the individual (Ripley), instead of institutions like the military, corporations, or the government.[203] The Bishop character also allows Ripley to confront her distrust of androids that resulted from the deception of Ash (portrayed by Ian Holm) in Alien. Unlike Ash, Bishop is openly an android and conveys both a similarly unassuming personality and a fascination with the alien creatures. Aliens imbues Bishop with a degree of humanity as he volunteers for a potentially suicidal mission. Although the other characters assume he is artificial and thus unafraid, Bishop affirms, ""Believe me, I'd prefer not to, I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Motherhood**: The central theme of ""Aliens"" is motherhood, with an emphasis on Ripley’s maternal feelings for Newt and her willingness to die to protect her. This is mirrored by the alien queen's instincts to protect her offspring.
2. **Gender-Based Violence**: The reproductive cycle of the aliens can be seen as a violent, invasive process, with facehuggers forcefully implanting embryos into hosts, a metaphor for rape and violent birth.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

1. **Other**: Ellen Ripley does not fit neatly into traditional female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. She is a former officer and becomes a warrior-like figure, taking command in critical situations and engaging in combat. Her role transcends traditional gender roles, embodying both nurturing and warrior traits.

### Monstrous-Feminine

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Ripley could be seen as fitting into the ""monstrous mother"" category, in a positive subversion of the trope. She is ferociously protective and willing to go to extreme lengths to safeguard Newt, mirroring but opposing the alien queen’s monstrous mother role.

### Protagonist's Fate

1. **Survives**: Ripley survives the events of the movie, along with Newt, Hicks, and the damaged Bishop.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment

1. **Empowerment**: The story primarily focuses on female empowerment. Ripley overcomes the trauma of her past encounters with the aliens and gains agency and autonomy. She emerges as a decisive, competent leader who takes control of her own destiny and that of those she cares about.

In summary, ""Aliens"" tackles themes of **motherhood** and **gender-based violence**, portrays Ripley as a strong and multidimensional character not bound by traditional gender roles, and presents a narrative of **female empowerment** where Ripley survives and thrives in the end.",1,5,1,2,2,1
A Nightmare on Elm Street,1984,Wes Craven,M,Heather Langenkamp,F,"Teenagers in a small town are dropping like flies, apparently in the grip of mass hysteria causing their suicides. A cop's daughter, Nancy Thompson, traces the cause to child molester Fred Krueger, who was burned alive by angry parents many years before. Krueger has now come back in the dreams of his killers' children, claiming their lives as his revenge. Nancy and her boyfriend, Glen, must devise a plan to lure the monster out of the realm of nightmares and into the real world...",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nightmare_on_Elm_Street,"Teenager Tina Gray awakens from a terrifying nightmare in which a disfigured man wearing a bladed glove attacks her in a boiler room. Her mother points out the mysterious slashes on her nightgown. Tina's best friend Nancy Thompson and Nancy's boyfriend, Glen Lantz, reveal that they each also had a nightmare, also about the disfigured man. During the girls' sleepover at Tina's house, Tina's boyfriend, Rod Lane, arrives and they have intercourse. When Tina falls asleep, she dreams of the disfigured man who attacks her; in real life, Rod sees her fatally slashed by an unseen force, forcing him to flee as Nancy and Glen find Tina bloodied and dead.

Nancy's policeman father, Don Thompson, arrests Rod despite his pleas of innocence. At school, Nancy falls asleep in class and dreams that the man chases her to the boiler room. She deliberately burns her arm on a pipe, which startles her awake in class, and she notices a burn mark on her arm. Nancy visits Rod at the police station, where he describes Tina's death along with his own recent nightmares about the same man.

At home, Nancy falls asleep in the bathtub and is nearly drowned by the man. She then relies on caffeine to stay awake and invites Glen to watch over her as she sleeps. In her dream, she sees the man preparing to kill Rod in his cell, but he turns his attention toward her. Nancy wakes up when her alarm clock goes off. The man kills Rod, staging it as a suicide. At his funeral, Nancy's parents become worried when she describes her dreams. Her mother, Marge, takes her to a sleep disorder clinic where, in a dream, Nancy grabs the man's fedora with the name ""Fred Krueger"" written in it, and pulls it into the real world.

After barricading the house, Marge explains that Krueger was an insane child murderer who killed 20 children but was released on a technicality. He was then burned alive by the victims' parents who lived on their street, seeking vigilante justice. Krueger, now a vengeful ghost, is killing her and her friends out of revenge and to satiate his psychopathic needs.

Glen falls asleep and is killed by Krueger. Now alone, Nancy asks her father, who is across the street investigating Glen's death, to break into the house in 20 minutes. She rigs booby traps around the house and grabs Krueger out of her dream and into the real world. The booby traps allow her to light him on fire and lock him in the basement.

The police arrive to find that Krueger has escaped from the basement. Nancy and Don find a burning Krueger smothering Marge in her bedroom. After Don extinguishes the fire, Krueger and Marge vanish into the bed before Krueger rises behind Nancy. Realizing that Krueger is fueled by his victims' fear, she calmly turns her back to him and Krueger evaporates.

Nancy steps outside into a foggy morning where all her friends and her mother are still alive. She gets into Glen's convertible to go to school when the green and red striped top suddenly comes down and locks them in as the car speeds down the street. Three girls in white dresses playing jump rope chant Krueger's nursery rhyme as Marge is grabbed by Krueger through the front door window.","Freddy exclusively attacks teenagers and his actions have been interpreted as symbolic of the often traumatic experiences of adolescence.[75] Nancy, like the archetypal teenager, experiences social anxiety and her relationship with her parents becomes strained. Sexuality is present in Freudian images and is almost exclusively displayed in a threatening and mysterious context (e.g., Tina's death visually evokes a rape, Freddy's glove between Nancy's legs in the bath). The original script called for Krueger to be a child molester, rather than a child murderer, before being murdered.[76]

Wes Craven has explained that ""the notion of the screenplay is that the sins of the parents are visited upon the children, but the fact that each child is not necessarily stuck with their lot is still there.""[49] Robert Englund observes that ""in Nightmare, all the adults are damaged: They're alcoholic, they're on pills, they're not around"". Blakley says the parents in the film ""verge on being villains."" Englund adds: ""the adolescents have to wade through that, and Heather is the last girl standing. She lives. She defeats Freddy."" Langenkamp agrees: ""Nightmare is a feminist movie, but I look at it more as a 'youth power' film.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Gender Based Violence**: The film deals with the threat of a male aggressor (Freddy Krueger), whose attacks on the teenagers, particularly Tina's death, can be interpreted as symbolic of sexual assault.
2. **Female Sexuality**: Sexual undertones are present throughout the film, particularly in threatening contexts, such as Freddy's glove between Nancy's legs in the bath, representing the fears and anxieties associated with female sexuality and adolescence.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
**Adolescent Girl**: Nancy Thompson fits the role of an adolescent girl navigating the challenges of growing up, dealing with social anxiety, and the strained relationship with her parents.

### Monstrous Feminine
**Other**: Nancy is not portrayed as a monster in the story. Instead, she is a victim turned survivor who ultimately confronts and defeats the monstrous Freddy Krueger.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?
**Survives**: Nancy lives through the ordeal and defeats Freddy by the movie's end, though the final scene leaves some ambiguity.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
**Empowerment**: The story ultimately focuses on female empowerment. Nancy takes proactive steps to confront Freddy, set traps, and figure out how to defeat him. She gains agency and autonomy, particularly by the end when she realizes that her fear fuels Freddy and consciously decides to turn her back on him, thereby neutralizing his power.",2,2,2,2,2,1
The Invisible Man,2020,Leigh Whannell,M,Elisabeth Moss,F,"When Cecilia's abusive ex takes his own life and leaves her his fortune, she suspects his death was a hoax. As a series of coincidences turn lethal, Cecilia works to prove that she is being hunted by someone nobody can see.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man_(2020_film),"Cecilia Kass is trapped in a violent and controlling relationship with wealthy optics engineer and businessman Adrian Griffin, the founder and CEO of the human-computer augmentation company Cobalt. One night, Cecilia drugs Adrian with her diazepam and escapes his highly-secured house with her younger sister Emily's help.

Cecilia hides out with her childhood friend, San Francisco Police detective James Lanier and his teenage daughter, Sydney. Two weeks after Cecilia's escape, Adrian seemingly commits suicide and leaves her $5 million. His lawyer brother, Tom, handles the arrangements. Cecilia suspects another presence in the house after several strange events, but James assures her she is just traumatized and paranoid. During a job interview, she finds her work portfolio contents removed, then faints. The doctor says high levels of diazepam were found in her system. In her bathroom, she finds the same bloodied diazepam bottle with which she drugged Adrian.

Cecilia, accompanied by James, meets with Tom. She believes that Adrian faked his death and used his optics expertise to become invisible in order to torment her, but this idea is rebuffed. Later, an unseen force hits Sydney, who assumes it was Cecilia. While alone at the house, Cecilia tries various tactics to catch the figure she believes hit Sydney. She finds Adrian's phone in the attic, on which she immediately receives a text saying ""surprise"". Cecilia dumps paint down the attic trap door, coating an invisible figure. A violent struggle ensues but Cecilia escapes. She goes to Adrian's home to investigate his lab, where she finds an additional invisible bodysuit, confirming her suspicions. Right after she hides the suit in their former bedroom's closet, the invisible figure attacks again, so she flees and contacts Emily. The pair meet at a restaurant, where the invisible figure slits Emily's throat and places the knife in Cecilia's hand, framing her for murder.

While awaiting trial, Cecilia is remanded to a psychiatric hospital, where she learns she is pregnant. Tom offers to get her charges dropped if she agrees to ""return to him"" and raise the child, implying that Tom helped stage his brother's suicide. He reveals Adrian tampered with her birth control to impregnate her. Cecilia refuses the offer and steals a fountain pen from him. That night, she attempts suicide and lures out the invisible figure. When the figure tries to stop her, she stabs him repeatedly with the pen, causing the suit to malfunction. The security team arrives, but the figure incapacitates them before fleeing the hospital, with Cecilia in pursuit. To protect her unborn child, the figure instead threatens to attack those she loves. Cecilia races to James's house and finds the figure attacking him and Sydney. She shoots the figure to death but finds Tom in the suit. Police storm Adrian's house and find him alive, tied up and claiming that Tom held him prisoner. They conclude that Tom killed Emily as well, but Cecilia believes that Adrian set his brother up as the scapegoat for his crimes.

To get Adrian's confession, a now exonerated Cecilia meets him at his house secretly wearing a wire, while James listens in from a few blocks away. She agrees to mend their relationship, but only if he confesses to killing Emily. Adrian insists that Tom was responsible, but claims that the experience changed his outlook on life and how he treated her. After Adrian says the word ""surprise"", Cecilia excuses herself. Moments later, the security camera captures Adrian seemingly slitting his own throat. Cecilia returns and calls 911, apparently distraught. Out of the camera's sight, however, she coldly stares at a dying Adrian and taunts him, indicating that she had used the spare bodysuit to kill him. Cecilia leaves as Adrian dies on the floor.

When James arrives, Cecilia confirms what the camera captured. He notices she is carrying the suit, but agrees to keep silent and allows her to leave.",,"#### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Gender-Based Violence**: The movie prominently explores themes of domestic abuse, manipulation, and control through Cecilia's relationship with Adrian. The plot revolves around the psychological and physical torment that Cecilia endures and her struggle to escape from her abusive partner.
2. **Motherhood**: A critical plot point involves Cecilia's pregnancy, which Adrian manipulates to exert more control over her. This theme reflects issues related to reproductive autonomy and coercion.

#### Role of the Main Protagonist:
- **Other**: Cecilia does not fit neatly into the traditional female roles listed. She is neither a mother/housewife (though her pregnancy is a central plot point) nor an adolescent girl. She also does not have a professional role related to beauty/perfection or caretaking. Instead, she is a woman trying to regain control of her own life and autonomy against an abusive, manipulative force.

#### Portrayal as a Monster:
- **Other**: While Cecilia resorts to violence at the end, she is not portrayed as a monster in the sense defined by Barbara Creed. Her actions are a means of self-defense and reclaiming autonomy rather than embodying the monstrous-feminine archetypes listed by Creed.

#### Fate of the Female Protagonist:
- **Survives**: Cecilia survives the end of the movie's narrative, having eliminated her abuser and reclaimed her autonomy.

#### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
- **Empowerment**: The story ultimately focuses on Cecilia's empowerment. Despite being subjected to extreme psychological and physical threats, Cecilia overcomes them. She gains agency and autonomy by outsmarting Adrian and using his technology against him, securing her freedom by the movie's conclusion. She proactively takes control of her story and her future, embodying characteristics of empowerment rather than victimization.",2,5,2,2,2,1
Rosemary's Baby,1968,Roman Polanski,M,Mia Farrow,F,A young couple moves into an infamous New York apartment building to start a family. Things become frightening as Rosemary begins to suspect her unborn baby isn’t safe around their strange neighbors.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary%27s_Baby_(film),"In 1965, stage actor Guy Woodhouse and his wife Rosemary tour the Bramford, a large Renaissance Revival apartment building in New York City. They notice the previous tenant, an elderly woman who recently died, displayed odd behaviors. For example, she moved heavy furniture in front of a linen closet she had still been using. Despite warnings from their current landlord and friend, Hutch, about the Bramford's dark past, Rosemary and Guy move in.

In the basement laundry room, Rosemary meets a young woman, Terry Gionoffrio, a recovering drug addict whom Minnie and Roman Castevet, the Woodhouses' elderly neighbors, have taken in. Rosemary and Guy first meet the Castavets when they return home to find Terry dead of an apparent suicide, having jumped from the Castevets' 7th-floor apartment. They have dinner with the couple but Rosemary finds them meddlesome. She is bothered when Minnie gives her Terry's pendant as a good luck charm, saying it contains ""tannis root."" Unexpectedly, Guy, initially reluctant to socialize with the Castavets, becomes seemingly fascinated with Roman, visiting with him repeatedly.

Guy is cast in a prominent play after the lead actor inexplicably goes blind. With his acting career flourishing, Guy wants him and Rosemary to have a baby. On the night that they plan to conceive, Minnie brings over individual cups of chocolate mousse for their dessert. When Rosemary complains that it has a chalky ""under-taste,"" Guy criticizes her as being ungrateful. Rosemary consumes a bit more to mollify him, then discreetly discards the rest. Soon after, she grows dizzy and passes out. In a dream state, Rosemary hallucinates being raped by a demonic presence. The next morning, Guy explains the scratches covering Rosemary's body by claiming that he did not want to miss ""baby night"" and had sex with her while she was unconscious. He says he has since cut his nails.

Rosemary becomes pregnant, with the baby due on June 28. The elated Castevets insist that Rosemary go to their close friend, Dr. Abraham Sapirstein, a prominent obstetrician, rather than her own physician, Dr. Hill. During her first trimester, Rosemary suffers severe abdominal pains and loses weight. By Christmas, her gaunt appearance alarms her friends and also Hutch, who has been researching the Bramford's history. Before he can share his findings with Rosemary, he falls into a mysterious coma. Rosemary, unable to withstand the pain, insists on seeing Dr. Hill, while Guy argues against it, saying Dr. Sapirstein will be offended. As they argue, the pains suddenly stop and Rosemary feels the baby move.

Three months later, Hutch's friend, Grace Cardiff, informs Rosemary that Hutch is dead. Before dying, he briefly regained consciousness and said to give Rosemary a book on witchcraft, All of Them Witches, along with the cryptic message: ""The name is an anagram."" Using Scrabble tiles, Rosemary works out that Roman Castevet is an anagram for Steven Marcato, the son of a former Bramford resident and a reputed Satanist. She suspects that the Castevets and Dr. Sapirstein belong to a coven and want her baby. Guy discounts this and later throws the book away, making Rosemary suspicious. Terrified, she goes to Dr. Hill for help, but Hill assumes she is delusional and calls Dr. Sapirstein; he arrives with Guy to take her home and they threaten to commit her to a psychiatric hospital if she does not comply.

Rosemary locks herself into the apartment. Somehow, coven members get in, and Dr. Sapirstein sedates Rosemary, who goes into labor and gives birth. When Rosemary awakens, she is told the baby was stillborn. As she recovers, though, she notices her pumped breast milk is being saved rather than discarded. She stops taking her prescribed pills, becoming less groggy. When Rosemary hears an infant crying, Guy claims tenants with a newborn have moved in upstairs.

Believing her baby is alive, Rosemary discovers a hidden door in the hallway linen closet leading directly into Minnie and Roman's apartment, the same closet the previous tenant had blocked and the same hidden door the coven members had used to access the apartment to subdue Rosemary. Guy, the Castevets, Dr. Sapirstein, and other coven members are gathered around a bassinet draped in black with an upside down cross hanging over it. Peering inside, Rosemary is horrified and demands to know what is wrong with her baby's eyes. Roman proclaims that the child, Adrian, is Satan's son and the supposed Antichrist, and that he ""has his father's eyes."" He urges Rosemary to mother her child, promising she does not have to join the coven. When Guy attempts to calm her, saying they will be rewarded and can conceive their own children, she spits in his face. After hearing the infant's cries, however, Rosemary gives in to her maternal instincts and gently rocks the cradle.",,"**Themes Related to Womanhood:**

1. **Motherhood:** The central theme of ""Rosemary's Baby"" is heavily focused on Rosemary's pregnancy and her eventual role as a mother. The horror stems from the corruption of the very idea of motherhood, as Rosemary's pregnancy is influenced by sinister forces, leading to the birth of Satan's child.

2. **Gender-based violence:** The film also explores themes of gender-based violence, particularly through the rape and violation Rosemary experiences while under the influence of a demonic presence, and the subsequent manipulation and control by her husband and the coven.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**

1. **Mother or housewife:** Rosemary's primary role in the film is that of a housewife and eventual mother. Her actions and decisions are largely influenced by her domestic life and her pregnancy.

**Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?**

2. **Other:** Rosemary is not portrayed as a monstrous feminine figure in the sense described by Barbara Creed. Instead, she is a victim of the monstrous actions of others.

**Protagonist's Fate:**

2. **Survives:** Rosemary does not die at the end of the movie. Instead, she survives and ultimately succumbs to her maternal instincts, choosing to care for her demonic child.

**Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:**

1. **Victimization:** The story is predominantly about female victimization. Rosemary is subjected to psychological and physical threats for most of the movie and struggles to gain any real agency or autonomy. Her decisions are manipulated, and her reality is controlled by the coven, culminating in her reluctant acceptance of her role as the mother of the Antichrist.",1,1,2,1,2,1
Possession,1981,Andrzej Żuławski,M,Isabelle Adjani,F,"A young woman left her family for an unspecified reason. The husband determines to find out the truth and starts following his wife. At first, he suspects that a man is involved. But gradually, he finds out more and more strange behaviors and bizarre incidents that indicate something more than a possessed love affair.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_(1981_film),"Mark is a spy who returns home to West Berlin from a mysterious espionage mission to find that his wife, Anna, wants a divorce. She will not say why but insists it is not because she found someone else. Mark reluctantly turns the apartment and custody of their young son, Bob, over to her. After recovering from a destructive drinking spree, he visits the apartment to find Bob alone, unkempt, and neglected. When Anna returns, he stays with Bob, refusing to leave her alone with the child, but attempts to make amends. Anna leaves in the middle of the night.

Mark receives a phone call from Anna's lover, Heinrich, telling him that Anna is with him. The next day, Mark meets Bob's teacher, Helen; she inexplicably looks identical to Anna but with green eyes. Mark visits and fights Heinrich, who beats him. Mark then beats Anna at home, after which she flees. The next morning, they have another hysterical argument during which they both cut themselves with an electric knife, Anna on the throat and Mark on the arm.

Mark hires a private investigator to follow Anna and discovers that she has been keeping a second flat in a derelict apartment building. When the investigator discovers a bizarre tentacled creature in the bathroom, Anna kills him with a broken bottle. The lover of the now-dead detective, Zimmerman, goes to the flat himself, where he finds the creature and his lover's dead body. Anna beats Zimmerman in a rage before stealing his gun and then shooting him to death.

Anna continues her erratic behavior and recounts to Mark a violent miscarriage she suffered in the subway while he was gone. She claims it resulted in a nervous breakdown; during the miscarriage, she oozed blood and fluids from her orifices. Heinrich visits Anna at the second apartment and is shocked to discover the creature in the bedroom, as well as a collection of dismembered body parts in her refrigerator. She attacks him and Heinrich flees, bleeding.

Heinrich calls Mark and begs him to pick him up. Mark stops by Anna's apartment first and discovers the body parts; the creature, however, is gone. Mark meets Heinrich at the bar where he murders him, but stages it as an accidental death in the bathroom stall. He then sets Anna's apartment on fire before fleeing on Heinrich's motorcycle. At home, he finds Anna's friend Margie on the brink of death as she emerges from the lift, bleeding from knife wounds. She dies; he drags the body inside where Anna greets him, and the two have sex in the kitchen. Afterward, he makes plans to cover up Margie's death. He then discovers Anna having sex with the creature. Heinrich's mother phones Mark asking about her son. When he goes to meet with her, she commits suicide by taking several pills.

The next day, as Mark wanders the street, his former business associates pressure him to rejoin them. He is evasive and returns to Margie's apartment to find it surrounded by police and his former employers. He stages a distraction, allowing someone to sneak away in his car, but he is wounded in the ensuing shootout. Fleeing on the motorbike, he has a horrific accident and races into a building where he is pursued by Anna, the police, and his business associates. Anna reveals the creature, now fully formed as Mark's doppelgänger. Mark raises his gun to shoot it but he and Anna are gunned down by a hail of bullets from the police below. Bloodied and dying, Anna lies atop Mark and uses his gun to shoot herself. She dies in his arms and he jumps to his death through the stairwell. The doppelgänger flees through the roof.

Later, Helen is at the flat babysitting Bob when the doorbell rings. Bob implores her not to open the door, but Helen ignores him. Bob races through the flat into the bathroom, where he gets into the bathtub face-down, drowning himself. From outside, the sound of sirens, planes, and explosions fill the air. The silhouette of Mark's doppelgänger is seen from the frosted glass door. Helen stares, her eyes shining.","Trying to classify Possession, critics drew parallels with Roman Polanski's Repulsion and David Cronenberg's The Brood. Despite being referred to as a psychological drama[5][6] psychological horror,[7] and supernatural horror,[8][9] the genre of the film is still a matter of controversy.[10][11][12][13] As J. Hoberman notes:

Made with an international cast in still-divided Berlin, the movie starts as an unusually violent breakup film, takes an extremely yucky turn toward Repulsion-style psychological breakdown, escalates into the avant-garde splatterific body horror of the '70s (Eraserhead or The Brood), and ends in the realm of pulp metaphysics as in I Married a Monster from Outer Space.[14]
A number of critics deny the creature with tentacles exists within physical reality: it may be a reflection of Anna's psychosis; the product of Mark's inflamed consciousness, unable to accept his wife's betrayal;[15] or a kind of revenge of the director traumatized by his own divorce from his ex-wife.[16]

Some who have written about Possession have paid attention to the motif of doppelgänger throughout the film. Both spouses die, but they are replaced by doubles, ideal models of husband and wife. Anna ""grows"" a double of Mark from the creature, an indefatigable lover who is always by her side. The real Mark finds a copy of Anna in the person of the school teacher Helen – she is a gentle character and does not demand anything from Mark, being an ""ideal housewife"".[10][17]

Sociopolitical context
A photograph showing the Czech hedgehogs and a guard tower at the Berlin Wall.
Berlin Wall in 1977
As in the case of The Devil, the director placed political subtext under the layer of expressive horror after deliberately choosing Berlin as it was the least remote point from Poland and other countries of the European socialist bloc. The plot of Possession is not limited to an autobiographical description of a difficult breakup, separation and marital disintegration in family relations – at that time Żuławski also experienced a final separation from Poland.[18][15][a] Two houses in the film – the modern one, which is Mark and Anna's apartment, and the old abandoned house in Kreuzberg, where Anna hides the squid-like creature – are located next to the Wall. The film contains elements of a spy thriller. Mark, an intelligence agent, leaves his job for his family. Anna leaves her family to become an ""agent of the dark forces"". The confrontation ends with death for both, and in the last frames of the film, there is a direct allusion (the sounds of sirens and the rumble of explosions) to the armed conflict that began in the city divided in two, which could end in a nuclear apocalypse.[12][19][15]

Scholar Bartłomiej Paszylk writes that the metaphors present in the film also represent ""a disintegrating country. The very fact that the film takes place in Cold War-era West Berlin is quite significant for the metaphor of divorce—the wall that separates it from East Berlin being a symbol of disconnection of what was once united—but [Żuławski's] additional intention might have been for the Berlin wall to symbolize the Iron Curtain, and for Germany to symbolize Poland, a country he had to leave in order to keep making movies.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: Anna’s miscarriage, psychological breakdown, and the eventual neglect of her child Bob evidence traumatic motherhood.
2. **Gender-based Violence**: The film delves deeply into themes of physical and psychological violence, both inflicted upon Anna and perpetrated by her, such as when she is beaten by Mark and later kills various people.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
1. **Mother or Housewife**: Anna is depicted as a mother and housewife throughout the film, struggling with these roles due to her psychological instability and traumatic experiences.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Monstrous-Feminine**: Anna embodies several aspects of Barbara Creed's ""monstrous-feminine."" She is depicted with the monstrous womb through her violent miscarriage, and she takes on the role of the castrator by engaging in multiple acts of violence and murders. Additionally, her connection with the tentacled creature manifests elements of the witch or possessed body.

### Protagonist's Fate
1. **Dies**: Anna dies in the film, ultimately shooting herself using Mark's gun after being wounded by the police.

### Female Victimization vs. Empowerment
1. **Victimization**: The movie portrays Anna predominantly as a victim of her circumstances, psychological instability, and the violence that surrounds her. While she exhibits moments of aggression, she fails to overcome her traumatic experiences or gain any lasting agency. The narrative focuses more on her downward spiral and struggle for survival rather than any form of empowerment.

Raw,2016,Julia Ducournau,F,Garance Marillier,F,"In Justine’s family everyone is a vet and a vegetarian. At 16, she’s a gifted teen ready to take on her first year in vet school, where her older sister also studies. There, she gets no time to settle: hazing starts right away. Justine is forced to eat raw meat for the first time in her life. Unexpected consequences emerge as her true self begins to form.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_(film),"Lifelong vegetarian Justine begins her first semester at veterinary school, the same one her older sister Alexia is attending and where their parents met. On her first night, she meets her gay roommate Adrien, and they are forced to partake in a week-long hazing ritual, welcoming the new students. They are brought to a party, where Alexia shows Justine old class photos of students bathed in blood, including one with their parents. The next morning, the new class is splattered with blood and is forced to eat raw rabbit kidneys. Justine refuses because of her vegetarianism, but Alexia forces her to eat one. Justine leaves with Adrien and later discovers an itchy rash all over her body. She goes to the doctor, who diagnoses her with food poisoning and gives her cream for the rash.

The next day, Justine begins having cravings for meat, which makes her feel ashamed. After a failed attempt to steal a burger from the cafeteria, she and Adrien take a late-night trip to a gas station so no one will see her eating meat. Unsatisfied, she eats raw chicken in the morning, and later throws up a long bundle of her own hair she had been chewing on. That night, Alexia attempts to give her a bikini wax, but when Alexia tries to cut the wax off with sharp scissors, Justine kicks her away and Alexia accidentally cuts off her own finger. Alexia faints, and Justine picks up the finger, tastes the blood, and starts eating it. Alexia wakes up to find Justine doing this but later tells their parents that her dog, Quicky, ate it.

The next morning, Alexia takes Justine to a deserted road, where Alexia jumps in front of a car, causing the two people in it to crash into a tree. Alexia starts eating one of the passengers so that her sister will ""learn""; Justine is dismayed. Despite this, Justine's craving for human meat grows and she starts lusting after Adrien. That night, she arrives at a party, where paint is thrown at her as part of another hazing ritual and she is forced to make out with someone. While kissing, Justine bites the middle of his bottom lip off, leaving the other party guests shocked and disgusted. Justine goes back to her dorm and takes a shower, where she picks a chunk of his lip out of her teeth and eats it. Justine confides in Adrien and they end up having sex, during which Justine tries to bite Adrien but instead bites her own arm until it bleeds profusely, seeming to orgasm while doing so.

At another party, Justine gets extremely intoxicated and Alexia takes her to the morgue. The next day, everyone in school stares at Justine, some avoiding her. Adrien shows her a video where Justine is crawling on all fours, attempting to take a bite out of the arm of a corpse as Alexia eggs her on, to boos and cheers from a crowd of watching party guests. Justine confronts Alexia and fights her, eventually biting each other until they are pulled apart by other students. Justine helps Alexia up, and they walk each other back to their dorms. The next morning, Justine wakes up in bed with Adrien but she notices she is covered in blood. She pulls off the blankets, finding Adrien dead with most of his right leg eaten and a stab wound in his back. Justine then sees a bloody Alexia slumped on the floor. Justine is initially furious that Alexia killed Adrien but then cleans Alexia and herself up in the shower.

Alexia is imprisoned for the murder of Adrien, and Justine is sent back home. There, Justine's father tells her that what happened is neither hers nor Alexia's fault. He explains that when he first met their mother, he could not understand why she did not want to be with him. Her father says he finally realized when they kissed the first time, indicating a scar on his lip. He then opens his shirt, revealing scars and missing chunks of his chest, and tells Justine that she will find a solution.

","Coming-of-age

Raw follows Justine's coming-of-age throughout the film. The audience experiences Justine's journey into vet school and her assimilation (or lack thereof) into this new society. Ducournau throughout the film creates references to other classic coming-of-age cinema that came before her film, for example a reference to Carrie being assaulted with Pig's Blood. The film uses cannibalism as an extended metaphor for the horror and uncertainty that can come with entering academia.[9]

Sisterhood

Raw focuses on the central familial relationship between the two sisters, Alexia and Justine. The duality of the two sisters is established early on in the film as an idealized good girl[10] and the rebellious older sister. The film follows primarily Justine's journey into a world where Alexia is already well-adapted. Alexia begins to have a predatory relationship, manipulating Justine into becoming a traditionally more feminine[11] version of herself. The sister's relationship is strained later on in the movie, as the jealousy over each other's relationship with Adrien sets in. Though this strain leads to tragedy with the death of Adrien, the sisterhood remains intact.","### Movie Title: **Raw**

Titane,2021,Julia Ducournau,F,Vincent Lindon,F,"A woman with a metal plate in her head from a childhood car accident embarks on a bizarre journey, bringing her into contact with a firefighter who's reunited with his missing son after 10 years.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titane,"A little girl named Alexia annoys her father during a drive. As she removes her seatbelt, her father turns around to scold her, causing a car crash. Alexia suffers a skull injury and has a titanium plate fitted into her head. When she gets out of the hospital, she shuns her parents and embraces their car passionately.

Years later, Alexia, now an adult with a large scar on the side of her head, works as a showgirl at a motor show. One night, after a show, a male fan follows Alexia in the showroom's parking lot, declares his love to her, and forcibly kisses her; she then brutally kills him using her large metal hair stick. As she returns to the showroom to shower, Alexia finds that the car she modeled with earlier has turned on by itself. She enters it naked, has sex with the car, and climaxes.

It is revealed that Alexia is a serial killer who has murdered several men and women in the past few months. She still lives with her parents, who seem unaware of her connection with the crimes and with whom she has a distant relationship.

Alexia attends a house party, where she starts to have sex with her coworker Justine. However, motor oil begins secreting from her vagina. She takes a pregnancy test, which returns a positive result, and tries to perform an abortion on the spot, using her hair stick, but fails. She comes out of the bathroom and murders Justine and the other guests, but one woman manages to escape. Alexia returns home and tries to burn a bloodied blanket, which sets the house on fire. She locks her parents in their bedroom and leaves.

Now wanted for murder, Alexia alters her appearance to pretend to be Adrien Legrand, a young boy who had disappeared ten years before, at age seven, by cutting her hair, taping down her breasts and pregnant belly, and breaking her own nose. She then goes to the police claiming that she is Adrien, where his father, Vincent, a fire captain, accepts Alexia as his missing son and refuses to do a DNA test.

Vincent takes Alexia to the station where he lives and works, and introduces her to his men. The firefighters are puzzled by the mute, androgynous, and apparently traumatized ""Adrien"", but they refrain from questioning the captain's behavior. Alexia becomes an apprentice at the station, under Vincent's supervision. As Vincent gives more responsibility to his ""son"" over the other experienced firefighters, one firefighter confronts Vincent about ""Adrien's"" identity. However, Vincent immediately shuts him down and tells him to never speak of his son.

Vincent tries to preserve his strength by injecting steroids into his aging body, but he finds that he seems to be building an immunity to them. Alexia is increasingly disturbed by his possessiveness and considers escaping from the fire station. However, after Vincent experiences an arrhythmia after injecting a large dose of steroids, Alexia decides to stay with him.

Vincent's long-estranged ex-wife comes to see her ""son"", and ends up discovering a now-heavily pregnant Alexia without her body taped down. She nevertheless keeps the secret for herself, not wishing to interfere with her ex-husband's delusion, and begs Alexia to take care of him. Vincent eventually acknowledges his delusion, telling Alexia that ""whoever you are, you are my son."" When he inadvertently uncovers her breasts, he is shocked but continues caring for her.

At a party at the fire station, the firefighters urge ""Adrien"" to dance to the music. Alexia performs her showgirl choreography, confusing everyone. Vincent, disappointed, walks out of the crowd. After the party, Alexia has sex with a fire engine.

Alexia's body gradually breaks down, as the skin of her stomach tears to reveal new metal plates. When her pregnancy comes to term, Alexia reveals her real name to Vincent, briefly attempting to seduce him and then begging for his help. Vincent helps Alexia give birth, the titanium side of her skull splitting open on her final push, killing her. The newborn's body appears with patches of titanium on its body. Vincent says repeatedly to the baby, ""I'm here.""",,"Given the plot summary and the lack of detailed themes from the Wiki_Themes column, here is the analysis of ""Titane"":

### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth)**
   - The film heavily centers around Alexia's bizarre pregnancy, including her attempts at abortion and eventual childbirth.
2. **Female sexuality (such as coming of age)**
   - The movie explores Alexia's sexual encounters, behavior, and identity in various complicated contexts, including her interactions with the car and her transformation into ""Adrien.""

### Role of the Main Protagonist
**Other**
- Alexia is neither a mother nor a housewife, nor does she fit strictly into traditional professional roles related to beauty, perfection, or caretaking. Instead, her role is complex and multifaceted—she is depicted as both a showgirl and a serial killer, and later as someone masquerading as a missing boy.

### Monstrous Feminine
**Monstrous feminine (monstrous womb)**
- Alexia embodies characteristics of the ""monstrous womb,"" particularly through her abnormal pregnancy and eventual childbirth, which features grotesque elements like metal plates forming in her body.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist
**Dies**
- Alexia dies during childbirth, as her body and skull split open.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
**Victimization**
- The story primarily focuses on physical and psychological threats posed to Alexia, alongside her alienation and transformation. She undergoes extreme physical changes and faces societal and personal challenges but is constantly subjected to threats without gaining significant agency or control over her life circumstances.

This analysis should provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the film ""Titane"" within the requested thematic framework.",1,5,1,1,1,1
The Babadook,2014,Jennifer Kent,F,Essie Davis,F,"A single mother, plagued by the violent death of her husband, battles with her son's fear of a monster lurking in the house, but soon discovers a sinister presence all around her.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Babadook,"Amelia Vanek is a troubled, exhausted widow and single mother of six-year-old Samuel, living in Adelaide. Her husband, Oskar, was killed in a car accident while driving her to the hospital during labour. Sam begins displaying erratic behaviour, causing problems at school and in their social life, and becomes preoccupied with an imaginary monster, which he has built weapons to fight. One night, he asks his mother to read a pop-up book, Mister Babadook. It describes the titular monster, the top hat-wearing Babadook, which torments its victims. Amelia is disturbed by the book and its mysterious appearance, while Sam is convinced that the Babadook is real.

Strange events occur, such as Amelia finding glass shards in her food. She attributes the events to Sam but he blames the Babadook. Amelia rips up the book and disposes of it. At her birthday party, Sam's cousin bullies him, and he pushes her out of her treehouse, breaking her nose. He later has a vision of the Babadook and suffers a seizure.

Amelia finds the Mister Babadook book reassembled at their front door. New words in it taunt her; the book now contains pop-ups of her killing their dog Bugsy, Sam, then herself. Terrified, she burns the book and runs to the police station after a disturbing phone call. However, she has no proof, and leaves when she sees what looks like the Babadook's suit hung up behind the front desk.

That night, the Babadook attacks her. After the attack, Amelia becomes more isolated and impatient, shouting at Samuel and having more visions of the Babadook. She also exhibits violent behaviour, including cutting the phone line with a knife, and has disturbing hallucinations in which she sees herself murdering Sam.

An apparition of Oskar appears, offering to return if she ""brings the boy"" to him. Realising he is a creation of the Babadook, she flees but the Babadook finally possesses her. Under its influence, she kills Bugsy and attempts to kill Sam. Eventually luring her into the basement, Sam knocks her out with his contraptions. Amelia awakens and tries to strangle Sam. When he lovingly caresses her face, she regurgitates a black substance, which seemingly expels the Babadook. However, Sam reminds her that ""you can't get rid of the Babadook"", and an unseen force drags him into her bedroom. She saves him but is forced to see a vision of her husband's death. Furious, she confronts the Babadook, making it retreat into the basement. She locks the door behind it.

Amelia and Sam manage to recover. She is attentive and caring toward him, encouraging him in building his weapons and being impressed at his magic tricks. In the garden, they gather worms in a bowl. Amelia takes it to the basement. The Babadook tries to attack her, but she soothes it and it retreats to the corner, taking the bowl of worms with it. She returns to the yard to celebrate Sam's birthday.","Writing for The Daily Beast, Tim Teeman contends that grief is the ""real monster"" in The Babadook, and that the film is ""about the aftermath of death; how its remnants destroy long after the dead body has been buried or burned"". Teeman writes that he was ""gripped"" by the ""metaphorical imperative"" of Kent's film, with the Babadook monster representing ""the shape of grief: all-enveloping, shape-shifting, black"". Teeman states that the film's ending ""underscored the thrum of grief and loss at the movie's heart"", and concludes that it informs the audience that grief has its place and the best that humans can do is ""marshal it"".[69]

Collider also proposed that the monster ""seems to symbolize Amelia and Sam's shared grief/trauma over losing Oskar"" and that Amelia's efforts to suppress this led to it becoming stronger.[70] The writers suggest that ""healing from serious traumas in real life does not happen overnight, but takes a lot of mental and emotional processing. The Babadook warns of the dangers of trying to ignore or 'stuff' our traumas below the surface: this is the most dangerous place to put them because that's where we lose control of them and they gain control over us.""","### Identified Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood**: 
   - The movie heavily emphasizes Amelia's role as a single mother dealing with the challenges of raising her son Sam while coping with her own grief.
   - The narrative explores the negative aspects of motherhood, including the stress and strain that drive her towards mental instability.

2. **Gender-based Violence**/ **Female Empowerment**:
   - While not explicitly involving gender-based violence, there are elements of emotional torment and psychological abuse that Amelia experiences, both from the Babadook and her own son's difficult behavior.
   - It ends on a note of empowerment as Amelia manages to confront and somewhat control the Babadook.

### Role of the Main Protagonist (Amelia):
1. **Mother or Housewife**: 
   - Amelia is portrayed as a widow and single mother, whose main role revolves around caring for her son, managing the household, and dealing with the psychological trauma of losing her husband.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?
1. **Monstrous Feminine**: 
   - Amelia is portrayed as the ""monstrous mother"" when she becomes possessed by the Babadook and attempts to harm her son.
   - Her violent behavior and hallucinations make her fit into the category of the feminine monstrous, particularly under the influence of grief and mental instability.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?
1. **Survives**: 
   - Amelia survives the ordeal. She learns to manage her grief and control the Babadook, symbolizing a form of cautious recovery and adjustment rather than complete resolution.

### Does the Story Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?
1. **Empowerment**: 
   - Although Amelia faces significant psychological threats and near victimization throughout much of the film, she ultimately gains a measure of control over her grief.
   - The climax and resolution of the story show her taking active steps to manage her grief and improve her relationship with her son, signaling a form of empowerment.

In summary, ""The Babadook"" delves into themes of motherhood and psychological trauma, with Amelia's role strongly tied to her identity as a mother. Although she is portrayed as a monstrous feminine figure at moments, she is ultimately a survivor who overcomes her mental and emotional challenges, shifting the narrative towards empowerment.",1,1,1,2,2,1
Old,2021,M. Night Shyamalan,M,Vicky Krieps,F,"A family on a tropical holiday discovers that the secluded beach where they are staying is somehow causing them to age rapidly, reducing their entire lives into a single day.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_(film),"Guy and Prisca Cappa are going through a separation. To avoid saddening their young children, Maddox and Trent, the couple take them to a tropical resort as a final family vacation. At their hotel, Guy and Prisca are given complimentary drinks, and the children befriend Idlib, the resort manager's nephew. At night, Maddox and Trent overhear their parents arguing and play a message decoding game with Idlib. During the argument, it is revealed that Prisca has a benign slow-growing ovarian tumor.

The next morning, the manager invites the family to a secluded beach where three additional parties are present: rapper Brendan ""Mid-Sized Sedan"" and his female companion; surgeon Charles, his elderly mother Agnes, his wife Chrystal, and their young daughter Kara; as well as Jarin and Patricia Carmichael, a close-knit husband and wife. Trent discovers the corpse of Brendan's companion. Charles grows suspicious of Brendan, who reveals that he has been experiencing nosebleeds because of his hemophilia. After the children rapidly turn into teenagers and Agnes suddenly dies, the families conclude that the beach is aging them, with the occupants undergoing the equivalent of one year of aging every 30 minutes. At least one member of each family has an underlying medical condition. They discover that trying to leave will result in them blacking out and waking up back where they left.

In a fit of rage, Charles cuts Brendan with a pocket knife, and the group watches as his injury quickly heals. Prisca's supposedly slow-growing ovarian tumor rapidly grows in size at a life-threatening rate. Charles performs a successful surgery to remove it. Brendan discovers that the body of his companion has fully decomposed in a matter of hours. Kara and Trent continue to age into their late teens, and after having sex with each other, Kara gets pregnant at a rapid pace. She gives birth, but the baby dies due to the time rapidly passing. The attempts to leave grow increasingly tense as Charles's worsening schizophrenia causes him to kill Brendan. As the day goes on, Jarin drowns, Kara falls to her death, and Patricia suffers a fatal epileptic seizure. Guy's eyesight blurs, and Prisca suffers hearing loss. Trent and Maddox discover the notebook of a previous traveler, along with indications of their being watched. At night, Charles attacks Guy and Prisca in a schizophrenic episode; Prisca runs as Charles continues to attack Guy. Chrystal's hypocalcemia results in her bones rupturing, killing her. Prisca returns and slashes Charles with a rusted knife, instigating a fatal blood infection that kills him. An elderly Guy and Prisca make amends before dying moments apart from each other.

With only the now-middle-aged Maddox and Trent remaining by the next morning, the pair construct a sandcastle. They revisit a secret message given to them by Idlib, which Trent deduces is connected to an underwater coral passage. Believing that the passage will allow them to leave the beach without losing consciousness, he and his sister start swimming through the coral. After they seemingly fail to emerge from the water, a resort employee who is monitoring them reports that the entire group has died. He gives the news to the manager, who warns of a previous incident where a guest almost escaped from the beach. The manager then announces that trial 73 has concluded.

It is revealed that the resort is a front for a research team from the pharmaceutical company Warren & Warren that was conducting clinical trials of new medical drugs, which are administered to guests with medical conditions by spiking their drinks. Because the beach naturally accelerates the lives of the guests, the researchers have been able to complete the lifelong drug trials within a day. The researchers lure a new group to the beach, but are interrupted by Trent and Maddox, who survived their underwater swim, using the notebook as evidence that they give to vacationing police officer Greg Mitchel, who informs his boss of the researchers' crimes. The researchers are mentioned to have been arrested, with subpoenas sent to the rest of Warren & Warren, as Greg plans to reunite Trent and Maddox with their aunt.
","When NME's Beth Webb asked about the different themes tackled in Old, Shyamalan responded, ""It's definitely about our relationship to time and, in my opinion, our dysfunctional relationship to time that we all have. Until we're forced to examine it, whether it's a pandemic or the factors that are in this situation for these characters, they're trapped on this beach, and they have to reflect on their relationship over time. You see some characters unable to navigate this, and then some characters find peace. Why did they find peace, and how did they find peace in the midst of all of this chaos? So there's this conversation about that, the one that I'm having of myself with time.""[1]

At the Tribeca Film Festival, Shyamalan said that the film's focus on aging reminded him of his father, who has dementia, and his children as he watches them grow up. During the event, Alex Wolff compared the film to the COVID-19 pandemic, ""Coming out of COVID, it feels like time just stopped. And that's what the movie's literally about.""[2][3] At the film's premiere, Wolff was asked for his interpretation of the film and said it was ""an allegorical existential sort of meditation on getting older.""[4] Other cast members chimed in; Nikki Amuka-Bird said the film was about not taking nature for granted; Gael García Bernal said it was about questioning how time travels differently for other people; and Vicky Krieps found that it was about ""love and family and all these things that are much stronger than any fears — the fear of aging and the fear of death.""","**Themes:**

1. **Motherhood:** The movie briefly touches upon pregnancy and childbirth through the rapid aging and subsequent pregnancy of Kara. This segment showcases the accelerated pace at which traditional experiences related to motherhood, such as pregnancy, occur on the beach.
2. **Beauty, Perfection, or Aging:** The predominant theme of the movie revolves around the fear and effects of aging, both physically and emotionally. This is evident in the characters rapidly aging, and how different individuals cope with the inevitable changes to their bodies and relationships.

**Protagonist's Role:**

Prisca Cappa can be categorized under:
1. **Mother or housewife:** Prisca takes on the role of a mother, caring for her children Maddox and Trent while navigating the challenges presented by the beach's accelerated aging effects.

**Portrayal as a Monster:**

1. **Other:** Prisca is not portrayed as a monstrous feminine figure. Instead, she remains a maternal figure focused on the well-being of her family as they experience the rapid aging process.

**Ending:**

1. **Dies:** Prisca, along with her husband Guy, dies due to the accelerated aging. 

**Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:**

1. **Victimization:** The story portrays Prisca as primarily subject to the uncontrollable physical and psychological threat of the rapidly aging beach. While she takes action to protect her family, much of the narrative revolves around the immediate survival and coping with the irreversible situation, rather than gaining long-term agency or autonomy.",4,1,2,1,1,1
Climax,2018,Gaspar Noé,M,Sofia Boutella,F,Young dancers gather in a remote and empty school building to rehearse on a cold and wintry night. The all-night celebration soon turns into a hallucinatory nightmare when they learn that their sangria is laced with LSD.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(2018_film),"In the winter of 1996, a professional French dance troupe, led by manager Emmanuelle and choreographer Selva, gathers in a rural, abandoned school to rehearse an upcoming performance. After succeeding in completing the elaborate closing piece of the dance, the group commence a celebratory after-party, dancing and drinking sangria made by Emmanuelle, while Goth Daddy provides music. The diverse group has several personal issues and share gossip about one another during the celebration.

As the party progresses, the dancers get increasingly agitated and confused. When Psyché urinates on the floor, Selva begins to realize that something is wrong and that everybody is behaving strangely. The dancers eventually come to the conclusion that the sangria has been spiked with a hallucinogen, presumably LSD. At first they accuse Emmanuelle since she made the drink, but she points out that she drank it and is also suffering from its effects. Taylor, already resentful towards Omar for dating his sister Gazelle, points out that Omar, a teetotaler, has not touched the sangria and accuses him of being the one responsible. The group gets angry and locks him outside the building in freezing conditions.

Emmanuelle sees her young son, Tito, drinking the sangria and locks him inside an electrical room to protect him from the agitated dancers. Selva goes to the room of her friend Lou, who is also feeling ill despite not having drunk. Lou confesses that she did not drink because she is pregnant. Dom, strongly affected by the drug, enters the room, accuses Lou of spiking the drink and kicks her several times in the stomach, not believing her claim of being pregnant; Lou, injured, retching, and weeping, passes through an altercation between Alaia and Jennifer in the kitchen due to Jennifer's refusal to share her cocaine, during which Jennifer's hair is set aflame after Alaia pushes her against a portable stove.

A frenzied Lou confronts Dom on the dance floor, but the group, all heavily affected by the LSD at this point, turns on her and accuse her of having spiked the drink. At first taking up a knife to defend herself, the taunts of the group cause Lou to have a breakdown, and she ends up punching herself in the stomach and slashing herself with the knife on her face and arm as the group encourages her to kill herself, before being comforted by Eva.

Selva, hearing screams, forces herself to walk through the building in her drug-addled, hallucinatory state and finds Emmanuelle, who has lost the key to the electric room in which Tito is locked and is screaming for help due to hallucinations. While Emmanuelle desperately searches, Selva sees Taylor and a group brutally beating David, who has spent the night talking about and approaching women salaciously. When the school suddenly loses electricity and switches to red emergency lighting, someone laughingly shouts that Tito has electrocuted himself.

Ivana drags a heavily hallucinating Selva through the halls passing a distraught Eva in a shower, trying to wash off the blood from Lou's cuts. Entering Ivana's room, the two take shelter and begin to have sex. A distraught David stumbles upon the two and is kicked out by Selva. David tries to enter DJ Daddy's room but is also evicted. Rejected, David encounters Gazelle and her brother Taylor, starting to have sex. Gazelle flees from Taylor and stumbles into the central hall where the remaining dancers have descended into drug-induced psychosis, dancing wildly, writhing on the floor, chanting in tongues, having sex, and physically assaulting one another. Taylor catches up to Gazelle and professes his love to her, telling her only he can make her happy as she cries. Gazelle has a seizure and Taylor takes her to his room while David is attacked by another dancer who slams his head against the floor.

When police arrive the next morning, they find almost all of the dancers either unconscious or dead. Psyché continues to dance alone. Dom is curled up alone, sobbing. Omar has frozen to death outside while Emmanuelle has killed herself outside the electrical room out of grief. Tito's corpse lies beside the open door of the electrical junction cabinet. Gazelle wakes up next to Taylor, seemingly having forgotten the evening as Taylor instructs her not to say anything to their father. Eva is curled up naked in the shower cubicle. Jennifer is splashing water on her burned scalp, screaming. Lou exits the building, and writhes outside in the snow, laughing uncontrollably, having gone insane.

As the police search the building, Psyché, who has several books related to hallucinogens in her bag, and apparently suffering no ill effects from the acid, goes to her room and drops liquid LSD into her eye.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

2. **Gender-based violence (such as sexual or physical assault or abuse):** The movie depicts numerous instances of gender-based violence. Lou is physically assaulted by Dom when she reveals her pregnancy. Jennifer is assaulted by Alaia, resulting in her hair being set on fire.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?
1. **Other:** Selva is not portrayed as a monster in the traditional sense described by Barbara Creed.

The narrative focuses on their immediate survival rather than their empowerment, and there is little evidence of them gaining agency or autonomy during the film's runtime.",2,3,2,1,2,2
MaXXXine,2024,Ti West,M,Mia Goth,F,"In 1980s Hollywood, adult film star and aspiring actress Maxine Minx finally gets her big break. But as a mysterious killer stalks the starlets of Hollywood, a trail of blood threatens to reveal her sinister past.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaXXXine,"In 1985 Los Angeles, amidst the Night Stalker murders, Maxine Minx successfully auditions for the lead in a new horror film, The Puritan II, despite all of her previous film credits being in adult films. After sharing the news with her friend Leon and colleague Amber James, the latter invites Maxine to a party in the Hollywood Hills, which she declines. Maxine goes to work at her second job, a live peep show, where a mysterious, leather-clad figure watches with anger. She meets another adult entertainer, Tabby Martin, who also invites her to the party that Amber mentioned, but Maxine declines again.

The figure leaves a police evidence VHS tape containing the porn film Maxine and her now-deceased friends had attempted to make six years prior.[a] Upon watching it, she asks a confused Leon to find out where it came from. Meanwhile, in the Hollywood Hills, Amber and Tabby are killed and have their bodies branded with Satanic symbols. Maxine is invited to meet with John Labat, a private investigator who informs her that her previous crimes will be revealed unless she meets with his employer, telling her she must appear at a specific address on Starlight Drive later that night or risk repercussions. LAPD detectives Williams and Torres question Maxine about Tabby and Amber, but she refuses to answer them. She later sees Labat following her and attacks him, warning him to stay away from her.

Ignoring Labat's demands, Maxine begins reciting the script for The Puritan II. Elsewhere, Leon is murdered in his video store. The next day, the detectives attempt to goad Maxine into cooperating with them, but she remains steadfast. Maxine confides in her agent, Teddy Knight, who tells her he could not find anything on Labat but agrees to continue helping her nonetheless. On the set of The Puritan II, Maxine meets the star of the first film, Molly Bennett, who mentions a similar party in the Hollywood Hills. Soon after, Labat, angered by Maxine attacking him the previous day, chases her across the Universal Studios Lot with a gun before being caught and escorted away by security. Later that night, Maxine tricks Labat into following her, during which she, Knight, and her friend Shepard Turei ambush Labat, and subsequently trap him inside of his car to be crushed by a junkyard compressor.

Maxine visits the address Labat gave her, which leads her to a house in the Hollywood Hills. She finds Molly's dismembered body and learns the murders have been committed by her estranged father, a televangelist named Ernest Miller, with the assistance of the fundamentalist members of his ministry. Miller reveals he and his followers have been filming the murders to create a snuff film intended to expose Hollywood for what he sees as its sinful and corrupting nature. Thinking he can still ""save"" his daughter, Miller has his followers tie Maxine to a tree for an impromptu exorcism, which he also films. Torres and Williams interrupt the ceremony and cause a shootout, killing Miller's cohorts, injuring Miller, and giving Maxine time to free herself before the detectives are mortally wounded while pursuing Miller. Armed with a shotgun, Maxine eventually confronts her father at the Hollywood sign but is interrupted by a police helicopter.

Maxine envisions herself as a celebrity credited for helping stop her father, attending the premiere of The Puritan II and revealing in an interview that the film's director, Elizabeth Bender, will be directing a biographical film about her. Returning to reality, she shoots her father, telling him he gave her what she needed – divine intervention. A month later, Maxine continues her work on The Puritan II, hoping her success will never end.",,"## Horror Movie Analysis: MaXXXine

A Quiet Place: Day One,2024,Michael Sarnoski,M,Lupita Nyong'o,F,"As New York City is invaded by alien creatures who hunt by sound, a woman named Sam fights to survive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place:_Day_One,"Samira ""Sam"", a pessimistic, terminally ill cancer patient, lives at a hospice outside New York City with her cat, Frodo. Reuben, a nurse, convinces a reluctant Sam to join a group outing to a marionette show in Manhattan. While in the city, the group notices meteor-like objects falling from the sky. Shortly afterwards, hostile extraterrestrial creatures attack the gathered crowd and passersby. A meteor hits an ambulance, and the explosion knocks Sam unconscious.

Sam later wakes up inside the puppet theater with Frodo and other survivors, including Henri, who signals her to remain quiet. Announcements from military helicopters warn civilians to stay silent and hidden until the authorities can rescue them. Sam then witnesses fighter jets bombing and destroying the bridges leading out of Manhattan, preventing the creatures from leaving the island. One of the survivors begins to panic, and Henri accidentally kills him in the process of trying to keep him silent.

The power grid cuts out that night, causing the building's emergency generator to noisily activate. Reuben turns it off, but attracts a creature that kills him on hearing his shirt rip. A distraught Sam takes Frodo and leaves for Harlem. The military announces it is preparing to evacuate civilians by boat from South Street Seaport as the creatures are unable to swim. Groups of people start leaving buildings towards the evacuation point, but the volume of their crowded movement alerts the creatures, who attack them and cause a stampede. Sam flees in the opposite direction and is separated from Frodo.

Eric, an English law student, escapes a flooded subway station and encounters Frodo, following him back to Sam. She attempts to convince Eric to go south to the evacuation point, but Eric is in shock and follows Sam back to her apartment instead. While there, Eric learns Sam is an acclaimed and published poet. The next morning, Sam leaves alone for Harlem, but Eric finds her and they continue their journey together. Sam and Eric accidentally alert the creatures, and flee into a flooded subway. With no other way out, the pair are forced to wade through the deep waters, eventually waking a dormant creature that pursues them but drowns while they escape.

The pair end up in a ruined church, and while Sam rests, Eric ventures out alone to get pain medication for her from a pharmacy. He then rescues Frodo from a construction site, discovering a group of creatures led by a larger one feeding on the remains of an organic egg-like pod. Sam tells Eric that as a child, she used to watch her late father play jazz at a club in Harlem, and would get pizza with him at Patsy's afterward, something Sam always wanted to do before she died. Eric fulfills Sam's wish by taking her to the club, collecting pizza from another store, and performing a magic card trick to cheer her up.

Eric and Sam see boats in the river, filled with survivors escaping Manhattan. As the two leave together, creatures start to congregate along the shore. Sam gives Eric her jacket and Frodo, and then runs off to distract creatures by smashing car windows. As a result, car alarms activate which attract the creatures away from the coastline. Meanwhile, Eric and Frodo jump into the water and are pulled up into a boat by Henri. Eric then finds a note in the jacket written by Sam, telling him to take care of Frodo and thanking him for reminding her to live.

Sam walks into a deserted street as she listens to Nina Simone's ""Feeling Good"" on her iPod. Sam smiles as she unplugs her earphones, causing a creature to appear behind her.

Scream 2,1997,Wes Craven,M,Neve Campbell,F,"Two years after the terrifying events that occurred in Woodsboro, Sidney is now attending Windsor College in Cincinnati, and Gale Weathers' best selling book on Sidney's life has now been made into a major motion picture. When two college students are killed in a theatre while watching the new film 'Stab', Sidney knows deep down that history is repeating itself.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_2,"Two Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens, attend a sneak preview of Stab, a film based on the events of the Woodsboro massacre.[a] Briefly exiting the theater to use the bathroom, Phil is killed by the masked killer now known as Ghostface. Ghostface sits beside Maureen in Phil's place and stabs her repeatedly, unnoticed by the raucous crowd, leading her to climb up on stage in a cry for help, which the audience mistakes for a publicity stunt until she falls dead.

The news media, including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott is a student alongside her roommate Hallie McDaniel, her new boyfriend Derek Feldman, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy Meeks and Derek's best friend Mickey Altieri. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive: police officer Dewey Riley to offer Sidney protection, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale and her new cameraman, Joel Jones, unsuccessfully try to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the rape and murder of Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott.

That evening, Sidney and Hallie attend a party at the sorority house Delta Lambda Zeta. At Omega Beta Zeta, another nearby sorority house, Ghostface murders student Cici Cooper. After the partygoers leave to witness Cici's crime scene, Ghostface enters Delta Lambda Zeta and attacks Sidney. Ghostface injures Derek but flees when the police arrive. Later, after realizing that Cici is a diminutive for Casey, Gale theorizes that the new Ghostface is targeting students with the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims. Randy theorizes that the killer is likely someone Sidney knows and is patterning the killings after a movie sequel. Soon after, Ghostface calls Gale, Dewey, and Randy while they are together in daylight on the college campus. Despite their attempts to find him, Ghostface ultimately ambushes Randy, pulling him into Joel's media van, where he is murdered. Shortly after, Joel, fearing he will be targeted next, skips town.

As night falls over the campus, Dewey and Gale go to a building to review tapes of footage shot by Joel, hoping to spot the killer in the vicinity of the previous crime scenes, but Ghostface attacks them, stabbing Dewey. Two officers drive Sidney and Hallie to a safe house, but Ghostface intercepts the car and murders them. In the ensuing struggle, Ghostface is knocked unconscious, but recovers and kills Hallie. Drawn to music playing in the campus theatre[b] while seeking safety, Sidney finds Derek in the auditorium tied to a cross from an earlier fraternity hazing ritual. Ghostface arrives, revealing himself as Mickey, and shoots Derek, killing him.

Mickey reveals he intends to kill Sidney and allow himself to be arrested, so he can blame movie violence for the murders. Debbie arrives, holding Gale at gunpoint, and is revealed to be Mickey's accomplice, whom Sidney recognizes as Nancy Loomis, the mother of Woodsboro killer Billy. Nancy betrays Mickey and shoots him, affirming that she only used Mickey to frame him for their killing spree. Mickey fires his gun before collapsing, wounding Gale, who falls offstage. Nancy reveals she is seeking revenge against Sidney for killing Billy and that she killed Randy in Joel's news van for criticizing Billy. However, Sidney points out the hypocrisy of her motives, considering that Nancy's abandonment fueled her son's psychotic tendencies. The pair fight until Cotton appears and holds them at gunpoint. Nancy attempts to manipulate Cotton into murdering Sidney, reminding him that her testimony got him arrested, but to her shock, he instead chooses to shoot Nancy in exchange for an interview with Sidney and Diane Sawyer. As Sidney, Cotton, and a recovered Gale look at Nancy's body, Mickey suddenly resurfaces but is killed by Gale and Sidney. Sidney then shoots Nancy in the head to ensure she is dead.

When the police arrive, Dewey is revealed to still be alive and Gale climbs into the ambulance with him rather than taking the opportunity to report to the returning Joel.

Malignant,2021,James Wan,M,Annabelle Wallis,F,"Madison is paralyzed by shocking visions of grisly murders, and her torment worsens as she discovers that these waking dreams are in fact terrifying realities.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_(2021_film),"In 1993, Dr. Florence Weaver and her colleagues Victor Fields and John Gregory treat a violent, disturbed patient named Gabriel at Simion Research Hospital. Gabriel, who is able to control electricity and broadcast his thoughts via speakers, escapes captivity and kills several staff members. Weaver determines that he is a lost cause and the ""cancer"" must be removed.

Twenty-seven years later, Madison Mitchell, a pregnant woman living in Seattle, returns home to her abusive husband Derek. During an argument about her multiple previous miscarriages, Derek smashes Madison's head against a wall, drawing blood. After locking herself in her room, she has a nightmare of a person entering their house and killing Derek. When she wakes up, she goes downstairs and finds Derek's actual corpse before being knocked unconscious by the intruder.

Madison awakens in a hospital where her sister, Sydney, tells her that her unborn baby did not survive. After being interviewed by police detective Kekoa Shaw and his partner Regina Moss, Madison returns home. Madison reveals to Sydney that she was adopted at eight years old and has no memories of her prior life. The killer kidnaps a woman running a Seattle Underground tour and Madison continues to bleed at the back of her head. She later has another vision in which she helplessly watches Weaver being brutally bludgeoned by the killer.

Shaw and Moss discover a photo of Madison as a child in Weaver's house and learn that Weaver specialized in reconstructive surgery. After having a vision of the killer murdering Fields, Madison and Sydney approach the police for help. The killer calls Madison, revealing himself to be Gabriel. Madison and Sydney visit their mother and learn that Gabriel was Madison's childhood imaginary friend, but may also be someone she knew before her adoption. Shaw finds a link between the doctors and Madison hidden in Weaver's records, leading him to discover the murder of Gregory.

The detectives enlist a psychiatric hypnotherapist to unlock Madison's memories. Madison recalls that her birth name is Emily May and that Gabriel almost led her to kill Sydney in the womb. After Sydney was born, Madison forgot about Gabriel. The kidnapped woman escapes and falls from the attic of Madison's home, revealing that Gabriel was secretly living there. Believing Madison to be the culprit behind the murders, the police arrest her and place her in a holding cell. The kidnapped woman, revealed to be Madison's biological mother Serena, is taken to a nearby hospital.

Sydney goes to the now-abandoned Simion Research Hospital and learns that Gabriel is Madison's parasitic twin brother who appeared as a half-formed child facing out of her back. Weaver surgically removed most of Gabriel's body, but when she could not destroy his brain, she sealed him inside Madison's cranium where he remained dormant until Derek hit her head against the wall. Once freed, Gabriel could take control of Madison's body at will to commit the murders.

After being attacked by the other inmates in the holding cell, Gabriel bursts out of Madison's skull and slaughters them along with most of the precinct's officers before going to the hospital where Serena is recovering. He is intercepted by Sydney and Shaw, but quickly immobilizes both of them. Sydney deduces that Gabriel caused Madison's miscarriages by feeding on her fetuses to gain strength. As Gabriel attempts to kill Sydney for replacing him in Madison's life, Madison wakes up and takes back control of her body. In a black mindscape, she subconsciously locks an enraged Gabriel behind bars and says she will be ready after he promises to escape one day. With his influence gone, Gabriel sinks back inside her head.

Back in the hospital, Madison lifts the bed pinning Sydney and remarks that even though they are not related by blood, she will always love her as a sister. Serena looks on happily while the electric humming that accompanied Gabriel's attacks is faintly heard.",,"**Malignant**

### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood:** The theme of motherhood is significant in ""Malignant,"" particularly through Madison's miscarriages and her relationship with her sister Sydney. Additionally, Madison's biological mother, Serena, is also a figure in the climax of the story, connecting motherhood to the narrative.
   
2. **Gender-Based Violence:** Madison is a victim of physical abuse by her husband Derek, highlighting issues of gender-based violence. This violence indirectly awakens Gabriel, marking a pivotal turning point in the story.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Mother or Housewife:** Madison fits into the role of a ""mother,"" as she is pregnant at the beginning of the film and experiences multiple miscarriages. Her role as a housewife is also evident through her everyday life and interaction with her abusive husband.

### Portrayal as a Monster:
1. **Monstrous Feminine:** Madison does embody the monstrous feminine, as described by Barbara Creed. Gabriel, existing as a parasitic twin within Madison, represents the ""monstrous womb"" and ""possessed body."" At times, Madison acts as a monstrous figure when Gabriel takes control, reflecting the dual nature of her character.

### Fate of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Survives:** Madison survives at the end of the movie. She is able to take back control of her body from Gabriel and consciously locks him in a mental prison.

### Focus of the Story:
1. **Empowerment:** The story of ""Malignant"" ultimately leans more towards female empowerment. Although Madison faces incredible hardships and is subjected to attacks (both by Gabriel and external forces), she gains agency and autonomy by the end. She overcomes Gabriel's control, symbolically locking him away and saving herself and her sister, thereby taking control of her own story.",1,1,1,2,2,1
Under the Skin,2013,Jonathan Glazer,M,Scarlett Johansson,F,A seductive stranger prowls the streets of Glasgow in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Skin_(2013_film),"In Glasgow, a motorcyclist retrieves an inert young woman from the roadside and places her in the back of a van, where a naked woman dons her clothes. After buying clothes and cosmetics at a shopping centre, the woman drives the van from town to town, picking up men. She lures a man into a dilapidated house. As he undresses, he follows the woman into a void, seemingly unaware of his surroundings, and is submerged in a liquid abyss.

At a beach, the woman attempts to pick up a swimmer, but she is interrupted by the cries of a drowning couple attempting to rescue their dog, as it is pulled out to sea. The swimmer rescues the husband, but the husband rushes back into the water to save his wife, and both drown. As the swimmer lies exhausted on the beach, the woman strikes his head with a rock, drags him to the van, and drives away, ignoring the couple's distraught baby. Later that night, the motorcyclist retrieves the swimmer's belongings and tent, ignoring the baby, who is still on the beach.

The woman visits a nightclub and picks up another man. At the house, he follows her into the void and is submerged in the liquid. Suspended beneath the surface, he sees the swimmer floating naked beside him, alive but bloated and almost immobile. When he reaches to touch him, the swimmer's body collapses, leaving his skin. A red mass empties through a trough.

The next day, the woman receives a rose from a street vendor, purchased by another man in traffic. She listens to a radio report about the missing family from the beach. The woman enters a dark room and is examined by the motorcyclist. She seduces a lonely man with facial tumours but lets him leave after examining herself in a mirror. The motorcyclist intercepts the man and bundles him into a car, then sets out in pursuit of the woman with three other motorcyclists.

In the Scottish Highlands, the woman abandons the van in the fog. She walks to a restaurant and attempts to eat cake, but retches and spits it out. In a bus, she meets a man who offers to help her. At his house, he prepares a meal for her, and they watch television. Alone in her room, she examines her body in a mirror. They visit a ruined castle, where the man carries her over a puddle and helps her down some steps. At his house, they kiss and begin to have sex, but the woman stops and examines her genitals.

Wandering in a forest, the woman meets a commercial logger and shelters in a bothy. She awakens as the logger is molesting her. She runs into the wilderness, but he catches and attempts to rape her. During the struggle, he tears her skin, revealing a black, featureless body. The man panics and flees. She holds her peeled off face in her hands where it still moves and blinks at her. As the woman extricates herself from her skin, the man returns and douses her in fuel and burns her alive. Elsewhere, the motorcyclist stands on a mountaintop alone and looks out across a snowy field. The woman’s smoldering remains are shown as her ashes rise up in smoke and slowly descend to the ground.","Writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Duane Dudek speculated that Johansson's character assumes a human identity to collect information about humans as an alien intelligence might, inducing an identity crisis causing her to ""spin out of control like a broken machine"". He wrote that the motorcyclist can be interpreted as a companion, enabler, or pursuer, and that the ""tar-dark world"" where the woman submerges her victims may be a nest, a web, another planet or dimension, or a visual representation of how sex feels to her or them.[6] In the Guardian, Leo Robson wrote that Under the Skin deals with race and immigration. He interpreted Johansson's character as a ""kind of immigrant"", and that the film's title ""seems like part of an anti-racial slogan, a reminder that despite our racial or ethnic differences we share some basic components"".[7]

Critics highlighted the exploration of empathy as a defining human capacity, with Johansson's character coming to share in this over the course of the film.[8][9][10] Noting that a turning point occurs during Johansson's character's encounter with the man with facial tumours (played by Adam Pearson), the philosopher Colin Heber-Percy wrote: ""The film suggests it is our very weakness which we value, which makes us us. [...] [The alien] recognises herself in the world, in the middle of things; she recognises herself as subject among subjects. In short, she chooses (or cannot fail to choose) to become human, to empathise, to be weak as flesh.""[11] The lecturer Maureen Foster, who highlights Johansson's character's examination of herself in the mirror before releasing Pearson's character, writes that the film presents empathy as ""a definition for what is human"", with the alien discovering ""something in herself that was either lost or had never been there in the first place.""[12]

Though Glazer said he wanted to make a film ""more about a human experience than a gender experience"",[13] several critics identified feminist and gender themes. The Economist wrote that ""there is some aggressive sexuality in the film: women seem very vulnerable but then men's desires are punished"".[13] In The Mary Sue, Kristy Puchko wrote that Under the Skin ""creates a reverse of contemporary rape culture where violence against women is so common that women are casually warned to be ever alert for those who might harm them ... By and large men don't worry about their safety in the same way when walking home late at night. But in the world of Under the Skin, they absolutely should.""[14]

Robson wrote that Johansson's character is ""both a watcher and predator of men. In the society she enters, and to which she brings nothing besides a body, [she] is a sex object, in dress and demeanour a kind of sex toy; she might have come to Earth to prove a point about male expectations of women ... If Under the Skin communicates any gender-politics message, it does so through the disparity in excitement between the male characters' reaction to [Johansson] and that of the camera.""[7] The Atlantic journalist Noah Gittell noted how little hype Johansson's nude scenes attracted, despite her status as a Hollywood sex symbol, and wrote: ""The way the film frames it — with Johansson having removed almost all of her personality from the character — it doesn't play as even remotely sexual, and the scene, remarkably, barely attracted any hype.""[15]

The film is thought to be inspired by the Scottish folklore of Baobhan sith, female vampire-like creatures who prowl during the night preying on men.","### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Gender-based violence**: The main female character preys on men, reversing the typical predatory relationship seen in society. Also, the ending involves an attempted sexual assault, which is a critical moment of gender-based violence.
2. **Female sexuality**: The character's interactions with men revolve around seduction and sexuality, which reflects on female sexuality and male expectations of women.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

1. **Other**: The protagonist does not fit neatly into any of the traditionally female roles outlined. She is an alien assuming a female human form and preys on men. Her role is more that of a hunter or predator rather than fitting traditional female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness.

### Monstrous Feminine

1. **Monstrous feminine**: The protagonist fits the description of a female predator or vampire-like creature. She embodies the archetype of the monstrous feminine through her alien seduction and predation on men.

### Protagonist's Fate

1. **Dies**: The female protagonist is killed at the end of the movie by being burned alive.

### Female Victimization or Female Empowerment

1. **Victimization**: While the protagonist exerts a form of power over men throughout most of the film, she ultimately becomes a victim herself. The film highlights her vulnerability and lack of agency as she attempts to understand her own humanity and ultimately becomes a victim of gender-based violence. The story is more about immediate survival and her lack of autonomy rather than empowerment.",3,5,1,1,1,1
House,1977,Nobuhiko Obayashi,M,Kimiko Ikegami,F,"Hoping to find a sense of connection to her late mother, Gorgeous takes a trip to the country to visit her aunt at their ancestral house. She invites her six friends, Prof, Melody, Mac, Fantasy, Kung Fu, and Sweet, to join her. The girls soon discover that there is more to the old house than meets the eye.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_(1977_film),"In Tokyo,[a] a young girl known as Gorgeous, so called for her beauty, has plans for a summer vacation with her widowed father, a wealthy film composer who has been away in Italy on business. When he returns home, he surprises Gorgeous by announcing he has married a woman named Ryoko Ema. Distraught, Gorgeous goes to her bedroom and writes a letter to her aunt. She asks the aunt if she can come visit her for the summer instead. Gorgeous' aunt replies and allows her to come visit. Gorgeous invites her six friends: Prof, who is highly academic and very good at problem solving; Melody, who has an affinity for music; Kung Fu, who is athletic and especially skilled at kung fu; Mac, who has a big appetite; Sweet, who is bubbly and gentle; and Fantasy, who is a constant daydreamer, to come along with her. On arriving at the aunt's house, the girls are greeted by Gorgeous' aunt, to whom they present a watermelon.

After a tour of the home, the girls leave the watermelon in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's disembodied head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The encounter is initially disregarded by the other girls, but over time they also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house.

The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous' becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet's disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. The girls try to escape the house, but after Gorgeous is able to leave through a door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but discover Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girls' spirits up and they hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole.

Upstairs in the house, Kung Fu and Prof find Gorgeous wearing a bridal gown, who then reveals her aunt's diary to them. Kung Fu follows Gorgeous as she leaves the room, only to find Sweet's body trapped in a grandfather clock, which starts bleeding profusely. Panic-driven, the remaining girls barricade the upper part of the house while Prof, Fantasy, and Kung Fu read the aunt's diary.

The reading is interrupted by the giant-sized head of Gorgeous, who reveals that her aunt died many years ago while waiting for her fiancé to return from World War II. Her spirit remains, eating unmarried girls who arrive at her home. The three girls are then attacked by household items. Prof shouts to Kung Fu to attack the aunt's cat, Blanche. As Kung Fu lunges into a flying kick, she is eaten by a possessed light fixture. Kung Fu's legs manage to escape and damage the painting of Blanche on the wall, which in turn kills Blanche physically. The attacked Blanche portrait spurts blood, causing the room to flood. Prof tries to read the diary, but a jar with teeth pulls her into the blood, where she dissolves. Fantasy sees Gorgeous in the bridal gown and paddles towards her. Gorgeous appears as her aunt in the reflection in the blood and then cradles Fantasy.

In the morning, Ryoko arrives at the house and finds Gorgeous in a classic kimono. Gorgeous tells Ryoko that her friends will wake up soon and that they will be hungry. She then shakes hands with Ryoko and burns her away to nothing.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: The protagonist’s conflict with her father’s new wife brings up themes related to family dynamics, abandonment, and surrogate maternal figures.
2. **Other (Supernatural and Grief)**: The story also delves deeply into themes of supernatural forces and grief, particularly through the aunt's haunting presence and her perpetual mourning for a fiancé who never returned.

### Role of Main Protagonist
5. **Other**: The primary role of the female characters, especially Gorgeous, doesn’t fit neatly into one of the predefined categories. While they are young girls, they are not specifically portrayed as adolescents in a coming-of-age story. Gorgeous and her friends represent various archetypes (beauty, intelligence, athleticism, etc.) rather than traditional female roles related to vulnerability.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Monstrous feminine**: The aunt, whose spirit devours unmarried girls and continues to haunt the house, fits the archetype of the **""monstrous mother""**. Gorgeous eventually becomes possessed by her aunt's spirit, aligning her with the monstrous feminine as well.

### Protagonist's Fate
1. **Dies**: The movie suggests that none of the girls, including Gorgeous, survive in their original forms. Gorgeous is possessed and transformed, which can be understood as a form of death.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
1. **Victimization**: The story predominantly focuses on the girls’ victimization. They face supernatural threats throughout the film and lack agency, being subject to the whims of the haunted house and its ghostly inhabitant. 

The narrative does not provide the main female characters with the opportunity to overcome these threats significantly or to gain substantial agency, aligning more with themes of female victimization.",5,2,1,1,2,2
Immaculate,2024,Michael Mohan,M,Sydney Sweeney,F,"An American nun embarks on a new journey when she joins a remote convent in the Italian countryside. However, her warm welcome quickly turns into a living nightmare when she discovers her new home harbours a sinister secret and unspeakable horrors.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaculate_(2024_film),"Sister Mary sneaks into a superior's bedroom at night and steals a ring of keys to escape through the locked gates of a Catholic convent. Four hooded figures capture and break her leg then knock her unconscious. Mary later wakes up in a coffin and is buried alive.

Young novice Sister Cecilia turned to Christianity at an early age. After surviving a drowning in a frozen lake and being declared dead for seven minutes, Cecilia is convinced God had saved her for a purpose. She receives an invitation from Father Sal Tedeschi to join a convent in Italy that tends to dying nuns. Cecilia takes her final vows to adhere to the evangelical counsels and becomes a nun, being decorated with a rosary.

Cecilia befriends Sister Gwen and is struck by certain oddities, such as an elder nun having cross-shaped scars on the soles of her feet. The convent's chapel houses a Holy Nail relic that crucified Jesus. After having nightmares of hooded figures, Cecilia is shocked to learn that she is pregnant, even though she is a virgin. The convent's inhabitants begin to treat her as the next Virgin Mary, with many proclaiming the child is a ""blessing"".

Another nun, Sister Isabelle, tries to drown Cecilia out of jealousy and later commits suicide. Cecilia throws up one of her own teeth and her health worsens. Her request to be taken to a proper hospital is denied by Father Tedeschi. Gwen publicly chastises the convent superiors for this abnormality but is then taken away by Father Tedeschi and Deacon Enzo.

Cecilia notices the inscription ""2 Corinthians 11:14"" behind the Virgin Mary picture in her room, which leads to an ominous phrase in the Bible. Cecilia reads her file and is shocked to find information about her childhood accident. Hearing a woman screaming, she ventures further and is horrified to witness a hooded figure cutting out Gwen's tongue. An elder nun appears and silences Cecilia. She begs to escape, but the elder chastises her, saying that she will never leave the convent.

Cecilia fakes a miscarriage to be taken to the hospital, but the deception is exposed and she is tied up. Tedeschi explains that he was a geneticist before becoming a priest and used DNA samples taken from the Holy Nail to impregnate nuns in the hopes of ushering in a new messiah. Before Cecilia, Tedeschi's numerous attempts failed, often resulting in malformed fetuses. Tedeschi brands a cross into Cecilia's foot, a symbol also on many of the other nuns.

Cecilia makes another attempt to escape. She beats Mother Superior to death using a crucifix, and shortly afterward, her water breaks. She manages to strangle the cardinal with her rosary before dousing Tedeschi's lab in ethanol. Tedeschi arrives and tries to stop her through physical force, but Cecilia narrowly escapes by igniting the ethanol with a lighter.

Tedeschi manages to break out of the laboratory after extinguishing the flames and continues his pursuit against Cecilia, forcing her to flee into the catacombs under the convent. Cecilia finds Gwen's mutilated corpse along with a hole in the catacombs walls. Tedeschi finds her just as she is about to escape and a struggle ensues. Tedeschi tries to cut Cecilia's stomach open, but she stabs him in the throat with the Holy Nail relic, which she had previously stolen from the chapel. After exiting the catacombs, Cecilia agonizingly gives birth and bites through the umbilical cord herself. She is horrified by the sight of the baby, which is heard making strange, animalistic noises. Cecilia stumbles away to grab and lift a nearby rock, which she uses to crush it to death.","The film addresses themes of genetic modification and debates surrounding childbirth, abortion, and infanticide. Speaking with Fangoria, director Mohan recited a story wherein his family stopped attending church after hearing a pro-life sermon; however he held that the movie was not intended to have a social message.[12] The article reads

And though the film – which is, at the end of the day, about a forced birth by a religious institution laying claim to a woman's body – is already getting its share of blowback from certain conservative corners of the internet, Mohan is unbothered. ""I don't think of it as a problem. I think it's a necessary conversation, and if a film can inspire that conversation, then we've done our job. But I also want to be really clear: I want that conversation to be started by the audience. I don't want them to look at us and go 'Look at those social justice warriors!'"" Mohan seems more invested in having Immaculate carry out horror's other important mission: scarring people for life.[12]

Several critics likened Immaculate to a modern revival of the nunsploitation sub-genre.[34][35][36] Others noted the aesthetic and thematic influences of 1970s European horror cinema, including directors Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, and Roman Polanski.","### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Motherhood**: The main theme of the movie revolves heavily around pregnancy and childbirth. Sister Cecilia finds herself inexplicably pregnant and is forced into a scenario where her pregnancy is manipulated by religious figures for their own ends.
   
2. **Gender-Based Violence**: The movie depicts significant gender-based violence, particularly through the character of Father Tedeschi, who uses Cecilia's body without her consent for his experiments. This includes physical assault, psychological abuse, and violation of bodily autonomy.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

4. **Professional Related to Caretaking**: Sister Cecilia's role as a nun fits into the category of caretaking, as she is involved in tending to dying nuns in the convent. This is a traditional female role related to femininity but also involves elements of vulnerability and weakness as she navigates the abuses and torments within the convent.

### Monstrous Feminine

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Cecilia can be considered under the archetype of the ""monstrous womb"" and ""archaic mother."" Her pregnancy is both a miracle and a source of horror, a forced birth engineered by a religious institution laying claim to her body. Additionally, her ultimate violent acts in the story align her with the ""monstrous mother"" archetype, especially in the context of infanticide.

### Protagonist's Fate

2. **Survives**: Cecilia survives until the end of the movie. She manages to escape from the convent, fights off her pursuers, and eventually kills her newborn child, which is implied to be monstrous.

### Female Victimization or Female Empowerment

2. **Empowerment**: Despite the horrific circumstances and numerous attempts to victimize and control her, Cecilia ultimately takes agency over her situation. Her final acts of violence against her oppressors and her escape from the convent illustrate a journey of empowerment. She overcomes her physical and psychological threats and gains autonomy by the film’s conclusion, symbolized by her dramatic and brutal actions to ensure her survival and autonomy.",1,4,1,2,2,1
Fear Street: 1994,2021,Leigh Janiak,F,Kiana Madeira,F,"In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events which have haunted their town for generations ​are all connected — and that they may be the next targets.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Street_Part_One:_1994,"In 1994, Heather Watkins, a bookstore employee at Shadyside Mall, is stabbed by her friend, Ryan Torres. He murders her and several other mall employees before he is shot dead by Sheriff Nick Goode. The media reports the massacre as the norm for Shadyside, which they dub the murder capital of the United States. Meanwhile, the neighboring town of Sunnyvale is its polar opposite, as it is considered one of the richest and safest towns in the country. Many of the Shadyside teenagers believe that this is the result of the witch, Sarah Fier, who placed a curse on the town before being executed for witchcraft in 1666.

Deena Johnson does not believe in the Fier witch and has recently broken up with her closeted girlfriend Sam, who had moved to Sunnyvale. Josh, her brother, spends his time researching the town's history, and her friends Simon and Kate sell drugs in hopes of eventually leaving the town. Deena and Sam meet again at a vigil in Sunnyvale for the victims of the mall killings, where a brawl between the students of Shadyside and Sunnyvale breaks out. While returning home, Sam's boyfriend, Peter, begins tailgating the bus carrying the Shadyside students, leading Deena to almost throw a large cooler at the car in retaliation. A sudden nosebleed causes her to lose her grip on the cooler and Peter's car to crash. Sam survives and sees a vision of Sarah Fier before being taken to the hospital.

The following night, Deena and her friends begin to be stalked by someone whom they initially believe to be Peter and his friends. However, when Deena and her friends visit Sam, Peter is killed by Skull Mask, who proceeds to murder several others in the hospital and is revealed to be an undead Ryan. Sam and Deena seek help but fail to convince the police while Simon is attacked by Ruby Lane, one of Shadyside's past killers from 1965. The group realize that the car accident disturbed Sarah Fier's grave and that Sam bled on her bones, resurrecting several Shadyside killers. Josh deduces that Fier's curse is the reason for Shadyside's history of killings which began following her execution. They attempt to offer her a proper reburial but are attacked by the Camp Nightwing Killer. Realizing that the killers only want Sam and are attracted to her blood, they set a trap at school in an attempt to destroy the killers by burning them, but the killers manage to reanimate.

Sam reluctantly agrees with the group to be sacrificed despite Deena's protests. They save her when it is discovered that C. Berman, a survivor of the Camp Nightwing massacre in 1978, claimed to have seen the witch. They attempt to call her but receive no answer. Sam finds out that C. Berman also died, but was resuscitated. The group organizes a plan to kill and revive Sam using drugs from a supermarket pharmacy. There, Kate, Simon, and Josh attempt to fend off the Shadyside killers, but Kate and Simon end up being killed. Deena finally drowns Sam, causing the killers to disappear, and revives her using a combination of EpiPens and CPR.

Afterward, the police decide to place the blame on Simon and Kate, as they were known for selling drugs. Sam and Deena reconcile and publicly come out as a couple. Later that night, while Sam is at her house, Deena receives a call from C. Berman who tells her that there is no escaping the witch. Sam, now possessed, attacks Deena but is subdued and tied up, with Deena promising to find a way to free her.

1. **Female Sexuality**: The movie addresses female sexuality through the relationship between Deena and her closeted girlfriend Sam. Their relationship explores themes of coming out and acceptance within their social circles.
2. **Other**: The theme of **witchcraft** is prevalent in the movie, which historically has been tied to perceptions of womanhood and the fear of female power and autonomy.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Other**: Deena cannot be easily categorized into traditional roles. She is neither strictly a mother, housewife, adolescent, nor does she have a professional role tied to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. Deena is a protective and resourceful individual who takes on a leadership role, particularly in her efforts to save Sam and unravel the mystery of the witch's curse.

### Monstrous Feminine:
1. **Monstrous Feminine**: The concept of the witch, as portrayed by Sarah Fier, aligns with Barbara Creed's ideas of the ""monstrous feminine,"" specifically the role of the witch and the possessed body, as Sam becomes possessed by Fier's influence.

### Fate of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Survives**: Deena survives at the end of the movie, although she faces significant emotional and physical challenges, particularly with Sam’s possession.

### Focus of the Story:
1. **Empowerment**: The story focuses more on female empowerment. Deena and her friends take proactive measures to combat the supernatural threat. Despite the horrors they face, Deena gains agency and fights against the curse. Her determination and leadership abilities show empowerment rather than victimization.",3,5,2,2,2,2
Prometheus,2012,Ridley Scott,M,Noomi Rapace,F,"A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film),"As a spacecraft departs a planet, a tall humanoid alien drinks a black liquid, causing its body to dissolve. Its remains crumble into a waterfall and the alien's DNA falls apart and starts to recombine.

In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the ""Engineers"". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus, to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ship's crew travels in suspended animation while the android David monitors their voyage. They arrive in December 2093, after a 4-year faster-than-light trip.

The Prometheus lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which the team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise that the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but get lost in the structure. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder vase with him, while most of them ooze a black liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the contents of the cylinder. He intentionally taints a drink with a minute sample and proposes a toast to the unsuspecting Holloway, who drinks it, having stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.

Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn, and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifield's helmet. Fifield falls face first into a puddle. When the crew returns, they find Millburn's corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis and a holographic star map highlighting coordinates to Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to Prometheus, but mission director Meredith Vickers refuses to let him aboard. At his urging, she burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being previously infertile, is now in advanced pregnancy. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland, Vickers' father, has been in stasis aboard Prometheus. He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how not to die from old age.

A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus and attacks, killing several crewmen before being killed by the captain of Prometheus, Janek. He speculates to Shaw that the structure was actually an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon. The structure also houses a spacecraft. Weyland and the team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in Proto-Indo-European[4] to try to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw desperately flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the menace on Earth to exterminate all life forms, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process. The Engineer's disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, causing the death of Vickers.

Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. The Engineer forces open the lifeboat's airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto him. It thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineer's throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers David's remains and intends to reach the Engineers' home world in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity. With David's help, she launches another Engineer spacecraft and departs from LV-223.

In the lifeboat left on the planet, an alien creature bursts out of the dead Engineer's chest.

","The central theme in Prometheus concerns the eponymous Titan of Greek mythology who defies the gods and gives humanity the gift of fire, for which he is subjected to eternal punishment.[20] The gods want to limit their creations in case they attempt to usurp the gods.[52] The film deals with humanity's relationship with the gods—their creators—and the consequence of defying them. A human expedition intends to find them and receive knowledge about belief, immortality and death. They find superior beings who appear god-like in comparison to humanity, and the Prometheus crew suffer consequences for their pursuit.[20] Shaw is directly responsible for the events of the plot because she wants her religious beliefs affirmed,[53] and believes she is entitled to answers from her god; her questions remain unanswered and she is punished for her hubris.[54][55] The film offers similar resolution, providing items of information but leaving the connections and conclusions to the audience, potentially leaving the question unanswered.[55] Further religious allusions are implied by the Engineers' decision to punish humanity with destruction 2,000 years before the events of the film. Scott suggested that an Engineer was sent to Earth to stop humanity's increasing aggression, but was crucified, implying it was Jesus Christ.[54][56][57] However, Scott felt that an explicit connection in the film would be ""a little too on the nose.""[54]

Artificial intelligence, a unifying theme throughout Scott's career as a director, is particularly evident in Prometheus, primarily through the android David.[58] David is like humans but does not want to be like them, eschewing a common theme in ""robotic storytelling"" such as in Blade Runner. David is created in the image of humanity, and while the human crew of the Prometheus ship searches for their creators expecting answers, David exists among his human creators yet is unimpressed; he questions his creators about why they are seeking their own.[55][59] Lindelof described the ship as a prison for David.[55] At the conclusion of the film, David's creator (Weyland) is dead and his fundamental programming will end without someone to serve. Lindelof explained that David's programming becomes unclear and that he could be programmed by Shaw or his own sense of curiosity. Following Weyland's death, David is left with Shaw, and is sincere and interested in following her, partly out of survival and partly out of curiosity.[60]

Another theme is creation and the question of ""Who Am I? Who Made Me? Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?""[56][61] Development of the in-universe mythology explored the Judeo-Christian creation of humanity, but Scott was interested in Greco-Roman and Aztec creation myths about gods who create humans in their own image by sacrificing a piece of themselves. This creation is shown in the film's opening in which an Engineer sacrifices itself after consuming the dark liquid, acting as a ""gardener in space"" to bring life to a world.[57] One of their expeditions creates humanity, who create artificial life (David) in their own image. David then introduces the dark liquid to Holloway who impregnates a sterile Shaw, and the resulting child impregnates an Engineer, creating the child of all three generations.[56] Scott likened the Engineers to the fallen angels of John Milton's Paradise Lost,[54] and said that humanity was their offspring and not God's.[62]

Shaw is the only religious believer in the crew and openly displays her religious belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she was created by the Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers.[56] In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.[63]

Beside drawing several influences from Paradise Lost, The Atlantic's Govindini Murty noted further influences, and wrote that ""[t]he striking images Ridley Scott devises for Prometheus reference everything from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man and Mario Bava's Planet of the Vampires. Scott also expands on the original Alien universe by creating a distinctly English mythology informed by Milton's Paradise Lost and the symbolic drawings of William Blake.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

Men,2022,Alex Garland,M,Jessie Buckley,F,"In the aftermath of a personal tragedy, Harper retreats alone to the beautiful English countryside, hoping to find a place to heal. But someone or something from the surrounding woods appears to be stalking her. What begins as simmering dread becomes a fully-formed nightmare, inhabited by her darkest memories and fears.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_(2022_film),"Following the apparent suicide of her husband James, Harper Marlowe decides to spend a holiday alone in the Herefordshire village of Cotson. Flashbacks reveal that Harper, tired of James's emotional abuse and manipulation, intended to divorce him. James threatened suicide in response. After James hit Harper in the face, she angrily locked him out of the flat. She then witnessed him fall from an upstairs balcony to his death, being partially impaled by a fence.

Upon arriving at the country house she is renting, Harper is greeted by its eccentric but well-meaning owner, Geoffrey, who gives her a tour of the house. Harper later goes for a walk in the nearby woods and comes across a disused railway tunnel. At the other end, a human figure begins screaming and running towards her. Frightened, Harper runs back through the forest until she reaches an open field. She turns back to photograph the landscape on her phone and notices a naked man standing in the distance, watching her.

The next day, during a video call with her friend Riley, Harper spots the same naked man in the front garden, his face covered with bloody scratches, further disturbing her. Realising that the front door is ajar, Harper quickly shuts and locks it, but the naked man sticks his hand through the letter box. Harper calls the police and the man is arrested, with one of the arresting officers resembling Geoffrey.

Harper visits a church, where images of the Green Man and Sheela na gig are carved on a font. Outside, she meets a young boy and a vicar who both bear a likeness to Geoffrey. After the boy leaves, Harper discusses James's death with the vicar, who suggests that she is partially responsible for James's death because she did not allow him to apologise. An enraged Harper leaves and later goes to a local pub, where she meets Geoffrey again. The few patrons and the bartender all bear Geoffrey's appearance. His policeman lookalike arrives shortly afterwards, informing Harper that the naked man has been released in the absence of any legal ground to keep him detained, to her chagrin.

Distressed by the recent events, Harper contacts Riley, who offers to drive to the village in the morning to accompany Harper for the rest of her holiday. As Harper attempts to text Riley the address, her mobile phone's service is repeatedly interrupted. She sees the policeman outside, but as the lights flicker, he disappears. One of the pub's patrons then appears and chases Harper, who retreats into the house. As she arms herself with a knife, a window breaks in the kitchen. Geoffrey arrives and finds that the window broke due to a crow, which he then euthanises by breaking its neck.

As Geoffrey goes into the garden, the lights flicker again and the naked man emerges, chasing Harper back into the house. When he reaches through the letter box and grabs Harper's hand, she stabs him through the arm. He pulls his arm out, the stuck knife ripping his arm in an extreme injury resembling the one James sustained during his fall. Both the boy and the vicar appear inside the house in turn, each of them now similarly injured. When the vicar attempts to rape Harper, she stabs him in the stomach and escapes the house.

While attempting to drive away, Harper accidentally runs over Geoffrey. He aggressively pulls Harper out of her car, takes control of it and chases her before crashing into a stone wall. The naked man, now in full Green Man form, approaches Harper, his ankle now severely broken and matching another injury on James's corpse. The naked man gives birth to the young boy, who in turn gives birth to the vicar, then Geoffrey, and finally James, heavily mutilating their bodies. Both Harper and James sit on a sofa inside the house. When Harper asks him what he wants from her, James responds that he wants her love. Riley—who is pregnant—arrives at the house in the morning. She follows a blood trail and finds Harper, who smiles when she sees her.

1. **Gender-Based Violence:** Harper experiences emotional abuse and manipulation from her husband, and the narrative centers on the repercussions of this trauma. Additionally, the vicar’s attempt to place the blame on Harper for her husband’s suicide and the menacing male figures reinforce the theme of gender-based violence.

2. **Other (Grief and Trauma):** While not directly listed in the given categories, the plot of ""Men"" deals substantially with grief and trauma as Harper struggles to cope with her husband’s suicide and her own feelings of guilt and fear.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
1. **Other:** Harper does not fit neatly into any of the provided categories. She is an independent woman taking a holiday alone, which does not conform to traditional roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness as outlined. Her role is more about personal healing and coping with past trauma.

### Monstruous Feminine
1. **Monstruous Feminine:** The film includes elements that align with Barbara Creed’s concept of the Monstruous-Feminine, such as images of the Green Man and Sheela na gig, along with the sequence of grotesque body horror births. These elements suggest a connection to archaic fears about the female body and its reproductive capabilities.

### Protagonist's Fate
1. **Survives:** Harper survives the events of the movie. The film ends with her smiling upon seeing her friend Riley, who arrives to support her.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment
1. **Victimization:** Despite surviving, Harper is subjected to relentless psychological and physical threats throughout the film. She is manipulated, endangered, and blamed, spending much of the movie simply trying to survive rather than gaining significant agency or empowerment. The film focuses more on her immediate survival amidst continuous threats.",2,5,2,1,2,1
The Birds,1963,Alfred Hitchcock,M,Tippi Hedren,F,"Chic socialite Melanie Daniels enjoys a passing flirtation with an eligible attorney in a San Francisco pet shop and, on an impulse, follows him to his hometown bearing a gift of lovebirds. But upon her arrival, the bird population runs amok. Suddenly, the townsfolk face a massive avian onslaught, with the feathered fiends inexplicably attacking people all over Bodega Bay.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birds_(film),"At a San Francisco pet store, socialite Melanie Daniels meets lawyer Mitch Brenner, who wants to buy lovebirds for his sister Cathy's 11th birthday. Recognizing Melanie from her court appearance regarding a practical joke gone awry, Mitch pretends to mistake her for a shop employee. Mitch tests Melanie's knowledge of birds, which she fails. He discloses his prior knowledge of her and leaves without buying anything. Smitten, Melanie buys the lovebirds and drives to Bodega Bay after learning Mitch has gone to his family's farm for the weekend. Melanie is directed to a teacher at Bodega, Annie Hayworth, to learn Cathy's name. Annie is Mitch’s ex-lover, but their relationship ended due to his overbearing mother, Lydia, who dislikes any woman in Mitch's life.

Melanie rents a boat and crosses the bay to discreetly leave the lovebirds at the Brenner farm. Mitch spots Melanie as she leaves and drives to meet her at the dock. As Melanie approaches the wharf, a gull attacks her. Mitch tends to her head wound inside a diner. Lydia arrives and meets Melanie, whom Mitch invites to dinner. At the farm, Lydia's hens are refusing to eat. Lydia dislikes Melanie due to her exaggerated reputation, as reported in gossip columns. Mitch invites Melanie, who is staying with Annie, to Cathy's birthday party being held the next day. Later, there is a thud at Annie's front door. A dead gull is found at the threshold.

At Cathy's party, Melanie tells Mitch about her troubled past and her mother running off with another man when she was Cathy's age. During a game, the children are attacked by gulls. Later that evening, as Melanie dines with the Brenners, sparrows swarm the house through the chimney. Mitch insists she delay driving back to San Francisco and stay the night. The next morning, Lydia visits her neighbor to discuss why their chickens will not eat. She discovers broken windows in his bedroom and his eyeless corpse, pecked by birds, and flees in horror. While recovering at home, Lydia fears for Cathy's safety, and Melanie offers to pick her up at school. As Melanie waits outside the schoolhouse, a flock of crows engulfs the jungle gym behind her. Anticipating an attack, she warns Annie. Rather than leaving the students in the building with its large windows, they evacuate them, and the crows attack. Mitch finds Melanie at the diner. When gulls attack a gas station attendant, Mitch and other men assist him outside. The spilled gasoline is ignited by an unaware bystander's match, causing an explosion. During the escalating fire, Melanie and others rush out, but more gulls attack. Melanie takes refuge in a glass telephone booth and watches in horror as mayhem erupts around the town. The blaze quickly spreads, but the fire marshals are unable to put it out because of the birds attacking them, cars crash and terrified townspeople and animals are brutally assaulted by the birds. Mitch saves Melanie, and they return to the diner. A distraught woman blames Melanie for the attacks, claiming (from what others told her) they began with her arrival. Mrs. Bundy, an ornithologist who scoffed at the reports of birds attacking, sits in stunned silence.

Mitch and Melanie go to Annie's house to fetch Cathy. They find Annie's body outside; she was killed by the crows while protecting Cathy. They take a traumatized Cathy home. That night, Melanie and the Brenners barricade themselves in the family home, which is attacked by birds that nearly breach the boarded-up doors and windows. During a lull, Melanie investigates a fluttering sound in the attic bedroom. After discovering that the birds have pecked their way in through the roof, Melanie is attacked, trapping her until Mitch pulls her out. Mitch insists they all drive to San Francisco to take Melanie, now injured, traumatized and catatonic, to a hospital. As Mitch readies Melanie's car for their escape, a sea of birds has gathered around the Brenner house. Mitch quietly moves the car out. The car radio reports bird attacks on nearby communities such as Santa Rosa, and that the military may intervene. Cathy retrieves her lovebirds (the only birds who do not attack) from the house and joins Mitch and Lydia as they escort Melanie past a mass of birds and into the car. The car slowly drives away as the birds watch.
","Themes
Among the central themes explored in The Birds are those of love and violence. The representation of the birds in the film constantly changes to reflect the development of these themes, and the story itself. At first, the lovebirds in the pet store signify the blossoming love between Melanie and Mitch, and the sexual tension between the two.[41] However, the birds' symbolism changes once they begin to attack Bodega Bay. Hitchcock stated in an interview that the birds in the film rise up against the humans to punish them for taking nature for granted.[42]

Humanities scholar Camille Paglia wrote a monograph about the film for the BFI Film Classics series. She interprets it as an ode to the many facets of female sexuality and, by extension, nature itself. She notes that women play pivotal roles in it. Mitch is defined by his relationships with his mother, sister, and ex-lover—a careful balance that is disrupted by his attraction to the beautiful Melanie.[43]

The theme [of the film], after all, is complacency, as the director has stated on innumerable occasions. When we first meet each of the major characters, their infinite capacity of self-absorption is emphasized. Tippi Hedren's bored socialite is addicted to elaborately time-consuming practical jokes. Rod Taylor's self-righteous lawyer flaunts his arrogant sensuality, Suzanne Pleshette, his ex-fiancée, wallows in self-pity, and Jessica Tandy, his possessive mother, cringes from her fear of loneliness.
With such complex, unsympathetic characters to contend with, the audience begins to identify with the point of view of the birds, actually the inhuman point of view ...

– Film historian Andrew Sarris (1998)[44]

Style
Montage editing and slow pacing are used within the film to build suspense and elicit a greater emotional response from the audience during the attack scenes: ""The pattern of The Birds was deliberately to go slow"".[45] This is exemplified in the scene where the birds gradually gather outside of the school, while an unobservant Melanie sits and waits on the bench. The camera then cuts between her and the increasing number of birds that swoop down onto the jungle gym behind her until they finally attack.

Eyeline matches and point-of-view (POV) shots within the film encourage audience identification with particular characters and their subjective experiences. This is achieved by cutting between the character and the object of their gaze. For example, when Melanie crosses the bay near the beginning of the film, the camera cuts between close-ups of her face and shots of the Brenner house from her perspective, as she watches Mitch fall for her prank.[46]

The focus on editing and visuals rather than dialogue is also an element of pure cinema that Hitchcock largely uses throughout his work.[47]

Hitchcock's behavior towards Hedren
More than fifty years after the film was released, it emerged in a series of interviews that Alfred Hitchcock may have behaved inappropiately towards Tippi Hedren during the filming of The Birds. Hedren said there were several incidents where she was subjected to sexual harassment from the famed director. Cast and crew described his behaviour on occasion as ""obsessive"" and Hedren claimed that ""he suddenly grabbed me and put his hands on me. It was sexual"".[48][49][50] She stated that she rejected Hitchcock's advances on numerous occasions.[48][49][50] Following the rejection, Hedren was injured during the filming of the phone booth attack scene, consequently suffering cuts to her face from a pane of glass shattering on her.[50] She said she was misled about the logistics of the final attack sequence because mechanical birds were replaced with real ones at the last minute.[50][49]

There has been speculation that ""Hitchcock's deliberate inflicting of injury was revenge for Hedren's spurning of his advances"".[51][50] Hitchcock also signed Hedren to a seven-year contract, which she stated restricted her ability to work.[52][50][49] These allegations were not brought to light until after Hitchcock's death.[53] Although they have never been confirmed, they have widely been reported, including by Hedren's co-star, Rod Taylor.

Hedren would later claim during a 2016 interview with Larry King that the sexual advances ""didn't happen until we were almost finished with Marnie"", that they had not started during The Birds, and that up until the end of Marnie Hitchcock had been ""easy to work with"",[54] but in her memoir released around the same time, she repeated the earlier allegations, though clarified that the sexual assaults didn't begin until Marnie.[50]

The controversy of this relationship is explored in the 2012 HBO/BBC film The Girl. Hedren's daughter Melanie Griffith claims that Hitchcock's abuse extended to her when he played a ""prank"" by gifting six-year-old Melanie with a wax figure of her mother in a miniature coffin.","**Horror Movie Analysis: The Birds**

**Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. **Female Sexuality (Coming of Age):**
   - Camille Paglia interprets the film as an ode to the many facets of female sexuality, which are central to the plot and relationships within the movie. The interactions between Mitch and Melanie, as well as Mitch’s relationships with other female characters, underscore this theme.
   - The evolving relationships and sexual tension between Melanie and Mitch, along with the backdrop of Melanie's past and her character development, also contribute to this theme.

2. **Gender-Based Violence:**
   - The film's themes implicitly touch on this aspect, especially given the documented inappropriate behavior of Alfred Hitchcock towards Tippi Hedren during the filming. Even though this behavior was off-screen, the resulting tension and Melanie’s portrayal as a character enduring severe stress and physical harm align with the theme of gender-based violence.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
1. **Other:**
   - Melanie Daniels is a socialite and does not fit neatly into the traditionally female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness as listed. She is proactive, chasing Mitch to Bodega Bay, and is more of a driven, adventurous character rather than fitting into the roles of a mother, adolescent girl, caretaker, or beauty/perfection professional.

**Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster:**
1. **Other:**
   - Melanie Daniels is not portrayed as a monster in the traditional sense. She is a human character dealing with extraordinary circumstances of nature turning against humanity.

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?**
1. **Survives:**
   - Melanie survives at the end of the movie. Although injured and traumatized, she is taken away from Bodega Bay by Mitch and his family.

**Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:**
1. **Victimization:**
   - The story focuses on Melanie being subjected to physical and psychological threats from the birds. Despite her proactive character and efforts to help others, Melanie ends the movie in a vulnerable and traumatized state, lacking significant agency or autonomy by the end of the film. The overarching narrative centers more on immediate survival than empowerment.

Overall, ""The Birds"" portrays a complex array of themes related to womanhood, particularly female sexuality and the implicit suggestion of gender-based violence in the professional context of the film’s production. Melanie Daniels, though a strong and proactive character, ultimately experiences victimization as the relentless bird attacks leave her injured and traumatized.",3,3,2,1,2,1
Happy Death Day,2017,Christopher Landon,M,Jessica Rothe,F,"Caught in a bizarre and terrifying time warp, college student Tree finds herself repeatedly reliving the day of her murder, ultimately realizing that she must identify the killer and the reason for her death before her chances of survival run out.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Death_Day,"After a night of drunken partying, Tree Gelbman wakes up on her birthday in the dorm room of classmate Carter Davis. She dismisses him, returning to her room. Her sorority housemate Lori Spengler gives her a cupcake, which she throws away. Tree meets with her married professor, Gregory Butler, with whom she is having an affair. That night, on her way to a party, Tree is lured into a tunnel and murdered by a figure wearing a mask.

She immediately wakes up back in Carter's bed and is unnerved to find the previous day's events repeating themselves. Baffled, she relives the day, this time avoiding the tunnel and reaching the party. However, the masked killer follows her and murders her again. Tree again wakes up in Carter's bed, realizes she is in a time loop, and barricades herself in her room to avoid death. The killer, already hiding inside, murders her a third time.

Waking up, Tree explains the events to Carter. He suggests taking advantage of the loop to identify her killer. She spends the next several iterations trailing suspects but is killed each time. After waking from a loop where she is bludgeoned, Tree faints and awakens in the campus hospital. When the killer shows up, she escapes the hospital in Gregory's car, only to be pursued and killed again.

Back in Carter's bed, Tree convinces him of her predicament by demonstrating her knowledge of the day's events. She sees a news report on John Tombs, a serial killer being held at the campus hospital. Concluding that Tombs is her killer, she rushes to the hospital to warn of his escape. Tombs breaks free and nearly kills Tree, but Carter follows and rescues her. Tombs kills Carter before chasing Tree to a bell tower, where she subdues him with a crowbar. Before delivering a fatal blow, she realizes that if she kills Tombs and ends the loop, Carter will remain dead forever. She runs to the top of the tower and hangs herself from the bell rope.

Tree awakens in Carter's dorm room and finds him alive again. Now confident in solving her murder, she proceeds happily through the day. She ends her affair with Dr. Butler and meets her father for lunch, where the two begin to reconcile. That night, she goes to the hospital and traps and kills Tombs. Relieved to be free, she celebrates her birthday in Carter's room and eats the cupcake Lori gave her.

Tree wakes up still in the loop. Horrified, she returns to her room with the intent to run away, when Lori offers her the cupcake again. Tree realizes that the previous loop was the only time she ate the cupcake, and she had died in her sleep, so Lori is her true killer. Lori had poisoned the cupcake, but when Tree failed to eat it, Lori used her job as a nurse at the hospital to frame Tombs for Tree's murder. Lori admits to also having an affair with Dr. Butler, whose preference for Tree drove Lori mad with jealousy. Tree stuffs the poisoned cupcake in Lori's mouth, then kicks her out of a second-story window to her death.

At a restaurant, Tree and Carter muse over the day's events, and he offers her his room for the night. The next day, Tree wakes up believing she is still in the time loop, but Carter quickly reveals he was just playing a prank on her and it is really the next day. Tree is too relieved to be angry at him, and the two kiss.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

Halloween,2018,David Gordon Green,M,Jamie Lee Curtis,F,"Laurie Strode comes to her final confrontation with Michael Myers, the masked figure who has haunted her since she narrowly escaped his killing spree on Halloween night four decades ago.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(2018_film),"On October 29, 2018, infamous serial killer Michael Myers, who has been institutionalized at Smith's Grove Psychiatric Hospital for 40 years following his killing spree in Haddonfield, is being prepared for transfer to a maximum-security prison. True crime podcasters Aaron Korey and Dana Haines visit the hospital, where Aaron displays Michael's mask to him, to no effect.

In Haddonfield, Laurie Strode still lives in fear of him, drinking heavily and rarely leaving her heavily-fortified house. She has a strained relationship with her daughter Karen, whom the state took away from her when Karen was 12. Allyson, Laurie's granddaughter, tries to maintain a relationship with her grandmother. The night of October 30, as Michael is being transferred, the bus crashes and Michael escapes after murdering two people and stealing their truck.

On the morning of October 31, Michael sees Aaron and Dana visiting his sister Judith's grave. He kills them both, as well as a mechanic for his coveralls, before recovering his mask from Aaron's car. Laurie learns of Michael's escape and attempts to warn Karen, but Karen dismisses her concerns, urging Laurie to move on.

That night, Allyson finds her boyfriend, Cameron, cheating on her at a party and leaves with his friend Oscar. Allyson's best friend Vicky and her boyfriend Dave are both killed by Michael. Deputy Frank Hawkins, who arrested Michael in 1978, and Laurie overhear the incident on radio and go over to the house. Laurie sees Michael for the first time in 40 years, and shoots him before he flees. The police take Laurie, Karen, and her husband Ray to Laurie's home for protection.

Dr. Ranbir Sartain, Michael's psychiatrist and former student of Dr. Samuel Loomis, persuades Sheriff Barker to help in the hunt for Michael. Michael kills Oscar, but Hawkins and Sartain rescue Allyson. Deputy Hawkins tries to kill Michael, but Dr. Sartain—who has become obsessed with Michael—attacks and leaves Hawkins for dead. It is revealed that he orchestrated Michael's escape to study him ""in the wild"". Dr. Sartain heads toward Laurie's home with an unconscious Michael and Allyson locked in the backseat together. Michael wakes up and kills Sartain while Allyson flees. Michael then kills the two police officers stationed outside Laurie's home, and strangles Ray to death.

In his showdown with Laurie, he stabs her and pushes her over a balcony. When he goes to check her body, he finds it missing, reminiscent of their first encounter decades earlier. Karen shoots him in the jaw before Laurie traps him inside the safe room with Karen and Allyson's help. The trio sets the house ablaze, and Laurie says goodbye to Michael before she faints. As her family takes her to the hospital, a final shot of the burning basement is shown, with Michael nowhere in sight.

Berman's house for help. Initially reluctant, Berman allows them inside and begins recounting the events of the Camp Nightwing massacre.

On July 19, 1978, Ziggy Berman from Shadyside is accused of stealing by Sheila, a Sunnyvale camper, and her friends. They accuse her of being a witch and in retaliation, hang her from a tree and burn her arm with a lighter before camp counselors Nick Goode and Kurt intervene. Ziggy's older sister, Cindy, and her boyfriend Tommy Slater are cleaning the mess hall when Nurse Lane, the mother of Ruby Lane, attacks Tommy, but he overpowers her and she is later removed from camp by police. The teenagers from Sunnyvale believe she was possessed by Sarah Fier, as was her daughter. While investigating the infirmary, Cindy and Tommy encounter counselors Alice, Cindy's former friend, and her boyfriend Arnie. They find Lane's diary which says that Fier made a deal with the devil by cutting off her hand on Satan's stone, thereby earning eternal life. They also find a map in the diary leading to Fier's house.

At the house, they find empty graves dug up by Nurse Lane and discover the witch's mark below the house. Alice and Cindy find a wall carved with the names of all the Shadyside killers and Tommy's name included. Tommy, now possessed, kills Arnie with an axe, and the girls escape into a cave. At camp, Nick helps Ziggy prank Sheila and lock her in the outhouse. As the two bond and share a kiss, Tommy reaches the camp and murders several Shadyside campers, including counselor Joan. Meanwhile, Cindy and Alice try to escape using the witch's mark in the diary as a map of the cave. They soon come across a pile of beating organs and when Alice touches it, it shows her flashbacks of all the past killers and their victims. After Alice injures her leg, she reconciles with Cindy and the two reach a cave opening beneath the outhouse.

After fighting an angry Sheila and knocking her unconscious, Ziggy and counselor Gary try to rescue Alice and Cindy until Tommy decapitates Gary. Ziggy hides with Nick until he is injured by Tommy and escapes to the mess hall. As the rest of the camp leaves via bus, Cindy finds a route to the mess hall while Alice stays behind. Tommy attacks Ziggy, but Cindy intervenes and kills him. Alice arrives and tells them that she found the witch's hand. She had started bleeding and realized that she was sitting near Satan's stone, where she dug it out.

The trio decides to end the curse by reuniting Sarah's hand with the body. Ziggy suddenly bleeds on the hand and sees a vision of Sarah Fier. This triggers the curse, resurrecting several Shadyside killers. A reanimated Tommy kills Alice before Cindy decapitates him. Ziggy and Cindy run to the tree where Fier was hanged, with the Shadyside killers in pursuit. They dig around the tree, only to find a rock with the words ""The witch forever lives"" carved. When Cindy realizes the killers are after Ziggy, she drops the hand and sacrifices herself. The two are murdered and the killers disappear. Nick later finds them and saves Ziggy via CPR.

Back in 1994, Deena and Josh realize that C. Berman is Ziggy, whose real name is Christine. They tell her that they found the witch's body and now, with the hand, they can end the curse. Deena and Josh go to Shadyside Mall, which was built after the closure of Camp Nightwing, and dig out the hand from under the same tree.

The Others,2001,Alejandro Amenábar,M,Nicole Kidman,F,"Grace is a religious woman who lives in an old house kept dark because her two children, Anne and Nicholas, have a rare sensitivity to light. When the family begins to suspect the house is haunted, Grace fights to protect her children at any cost in the face of strange events and disturbing visions.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Others_(2001_film),"In 1945, Grace Stewart resides in a remote country house in Jersey, a Channel Island formerly occupied by the Germans, with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas; both of whom suffer from a severe sensitivity to light. Because of this, Grace keeps the home darkened with heavy curtains. One day, Mrs. Bertha Mills, Edmund Tuttle, and the mute Lydia arrive, all seeking employment. Grace hires them as the housekeeper, gardener, and maid, and is pleased to learn the three worked in the same house years prior.

Anne claims to be regularly visited by a young boy named Victor, his parents, and an elderly blind woman. Grace believes this to be a fantasy, but after she begins hearing footsteps and disembodied voices herself, she orders the house to be searched, believing there are intruders inside. In a storage room, she finds a nineteenth-century photo album containing photographs of corpses. Mrs. Mills recounts that many left in 1891 due to an outbreak of tuberculosis. Grace begins to fear that there are supernatural entities in the house, but struggles to reconcile such things with her rigid Catholic faith.

At night, Grace witnesses a piano playing itself and becomes convinced that the house is haunted. She runs outside in search of the local priest to bless the house and instructs Tuttle to check the nearby cemetery to see if a family has been buried there. Tuttle covers gravestones on the grounds with leaves at the order of Mrs. Mills. In the woods, Grace runs into her husband Charles, whom she believed to have been killed in the war. Charles acts very distant during his short stay at the house, presumably suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in the war.

One day, Grace checks on Anne playing. To her horror, she instead finds an old woman wearing her daughter's communion dress who speaks in Anne's voice. Grace attacks the old woman, only to find that she has inadvertently attacked her own daughter. Charles informs Grace he must return to the front, rejecting her insistence that the war is over.

The next morning, Charles departs, and Grace is horrified to find all of the curtains in the house have been removed, exposing Anne and Nicholas to the sunlight. She accuses the servants of doing this and expels them from the house. That night, the children discover that the headstones in the cemetery belong to the trio of servants, and flee when they see the servants approaching them. Grace finds a postmortem photograph of Mrs. Mills, Tuttle and Lydia, who all perished during a tuberculosis outbreak more than fifty years prior. Mrs. Mills tells Grace to talk to the ""intruders"".

Grace discovers that the elderly blind woman is in fact a medium holding a séance with Victor's parents, who have discovered via automatic writing that Grace, despondent after Charles died in the war, smothered her children with a pillow before committing suicide. Aghast, Grace realizes that ""the others"" in the house are the living family planning to move into their house, and that like the servants, she, Anne, and Nicholas are ghosts.

Embracing her children, Grace admits to her act of murder–suicide: she had awoken afterward and believed the event to have been a nightmare. Following the supernatural activity in the house caused by Grace and her children, Victor and his family move out. Anne and Nicholas realize they are no longer afflicted by the sunlight as they had been in life. The house goes up for sale again and Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that they will have to learn to cohabit with the living residents, only for Grace to ominously state that the house is only theirs.
",,"### Analysis for ""The Others""

**Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. **Motherhood**: The central theme of the film revolves around Grace Stewart's role as a mother caring for her two children in isolation. Her protective instincts, struggles, and actions are deeply tied to her maternal responsibilities.
2. **Other**: Psychological distress and the inherent struggle with faith and reality are also prominent themes. Grace's struggle to reconcile supernatural occurrences with her rigid Catholic beliefs add a layer of psychological tension.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
1. **Mother or housewife**: Grace is primarily depicted as a mother who is highly protective of her children and is also responsible for maintaining the household in a strict manner.

**Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?**
1. **Monstrous feminine (monstrous mother)**: According to Barbara Creed's theory, Grace could be seen as the ""monstrous mother"" as she ultimately reveals herself to have smothered her children before committing suicide. Though done in a state of despondency and believing it to be an act of mercy, this action associates her with the concept of the monstrous feminine.

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?**
1. **Dies**: Although Grace is a ghost throughout the narrative, she had died prior to the events of the film due to a murder-suicide.

**Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?**
1. **Victimization**: The story focuses more on Grace's psychological and emotional trauma. While there are elements of her taking control of the situation (such as attempting to protect her children from 'intruders'), the overwhelming narrative is about her succumbing to despair, committing a grievous act, and ultimately existing in a state of denial and confusion, reflecting a lack of agency and autonomy.",1,1,1,1,2,1

However, Esther is not quite who she seems.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan_(2009_film),"In Hamden, Connecticut, Kate and John Coleman's marriage is strained after the stillbirth of their third child, Jessica, whose loss is particularly hard on Kate, a recovering alcoholic. She and John then decide to adopt a 9-year-old Russian girl, Esther, from St. Mariana's Home for Girls, a local orphanage. Their 5-year-old deaf daughter, Max, embraces Esther, but their 12-year-old son, Daniel, is less welcoming.

One night, Kate and John begin to have sex until Esther interrupts them. Kate becomes suspicious when Esther expresses far more knowledge of sex than expected of a child her age. Esther then exhibits hostile behavior in front of Max and Daniel, such as killing an injured pigeon and breaking the leg of a bullying classmate. Sister Abigail, the head of the orphanage, visits the household, warning Kate and John that tragic events and incidents occur around Esther, including the house fire that killed her previous adoptive family. When Abigail leaves, Esther causes her to crash her car on the road and then bludgeons her to death with a hammer. She forces Max to help her move the body and then hides the evidence in Daniel's treehouse. Daniel sees them at the treehouse, and later that night, she interrogates him about what he saw, threatening to castrate him if he tells Kate and John.

As Kate becomes further convinced about Esther's unusual behavior, John believes she is being paranoid and tells Esther to do something nice for Kate. Esther rips out the flowers from Jessica's grave and gives them to Kate as a bouquet. Kate is horrified and grabs Esther's arm in distress, asserting that she did this on purpose. That night, Esther breaks her own arm and falsely blames Kate, causing further strife in Kate and John's marriage. The next day, Esther releases the brake in the car, causing it to roll into oncoming traffic with Max inside. She also points out the wine she found in the kitchen, causing John and Kate's therapist to suggest Kate return to rehab, with John threatening to leave her and take the children if she refuses. Kate discovers that Esther came from a mental hospital named the Saarne Institute, and the orphanage she claims she was from has no record of her.

When Daniel learns about Sister Abigail's death from Max and searches the treehouse, Esther sets it on fire with him inside, but is thwarted by Max. Daniel is seriously injured, and while in the hospital in the ICU, Esther tries to suffocate him, stopping his heartbeats, but the doctors come in time to revive him. Kate, enraged, attacks Esther before being restrained and sedated. That night, Esther dresses provocatively and attempts to seduce John, who threatens to send Esther back to the orphanage. At the hospital, Kate is contacted by Dr. Värava of the Saarne Instituute and learns that Esther is actually a 33-year-old woman named Leena Klammer, born in Estonia. She has hypopituitarism, a rare hormonal disorder that stunted her physical growth and caused proportional dwarfism, and she has spent most of her life posing as a little girl. Leena is a violent serial killer and has murdered at least seven people.

While Kate is talking to the doctor from the Saarne Institute, Leena furiously removes her makeup that made her look childlike; the ribbons she wears around her neck and wrists conceal the livid scars she received from trying to break out of straitjackets during her time at the asylum. She also removes prosthetic childlike teeth, revealing her real, rotting teeth, and destroys her room. When the power goes out and Leena disappears, John enters her room and uses the aquarium blacklight to find graphic pornographic images, resembling himself and Leena. Leena then attacks John downstairs and stabs him to death.

Kate rushes home and, after finding John's body, searches the house desperately to find Max. Leena attempts to shoot her, wounding her arm. After Leena opens fire on Max in the greenhouse, Kate breaks through the greenhouse roof and knocks Leena unconscious. Kate and Max flee as police arrive, but Leena attacks Kate near the frozen pond, hurling them onto the ice. As they engage in a violent struggle, Max tries to shoot Leena herself but misses, hitting and shattering the ice. Leena and Kate are sent underwater, and Kate begins to climb out, with Leena clinging to her legs. Leena reverts to her Esther persona, begging ""Mommy"" not to let her die, while hiding a knife behind her back. Kate retorts angrily that she is not Leena's mother and kicks her in the face, breaking her neck. Leena's body sinks as Kate and Max are met by police.",,"**Themes related to womanhood:**

At home in his bare attic, Frank solves the puzzle and hooked chains emerge, tearing him apart. A black-robed figure resets the puzzle and the room is restored back to normal.

Later, Frank's brother Larry moves into the same house. He intends to rebuild his relationship with his second wife, Julia. Larry is unaware that Julia had an affair with his brother Frank before her marriage to him. When Larry accidentally cuts his hand moving furniture, his blood drips on the attic floor and resurrects Frank in a ghoulish form. Julia later finds Frank; still obsessed with him, she agrees to help restore his body, so they can run away together. Julia picks up men in bars and brings them back to the attic, where she mortally wounds them. Frank then drains their life, which regenerates his body. Frank explains to Julia that, having exhausted all sensory experiences, he sought out the puzzle box, which was supposed to provide access to a realm of new carnal pleasures. When the puzzle was solved, the ""Cenobites"" came to subject him to extreme sadomasochism.

Kirsty, Larry's teenage daughter and Frank's niece, sees Julia bringing a man to the house and follows her to the attic, where she finds Frank. She evades Frank and escapes with the puzzle box, collapsing shortly after. Awakening in a hospital, Kirsty solves the box out of curiosity, and unknowingly summons the Cenobites and a monster called the Engineer, which she narrowly escapes from. The Cenobites' leader (referred to by fans as ""Pinhead"") explains that although they have been perceived as both angels and demons, they are simply ""explorers"" from another dimension seeking carnal experiences, and they can no longer differentiate between pain and pleasure. When they attempt to force Kirsty to return to their realm with them, she informs Pinhead that Frank has escaped them. The Cenobites agree to spare Kirsty and re-capture Frank instead, with the condition that Frank must confess to escaping them.

Kirsty returns home, where Frank has killed Larry and has taken on his identity by wearing his skin. Julia shows her what is purported to be Frank's flayed corpse in the attic. Julia then leaves the attic, locking the door behind her. The Cenobites appear and, not fooled by the deception, demand the man who ""did this"". Kirsty tries to escape, but is held by Julia and Frank. Frank reveals his true identity to Kirsty and, when his sexual advances are rejected, he decides to kill her to complete his rejuvenation. He accidentally stabs Julia instead and drains her without remorse. Frank chases Kirsty to the attic and, when he is about to kill her, the Cenobites appear after hearing him confess to killing her father. Now certain he is the one they are looking for, they ensnare him with chains with hooks and tear him to pieces. When the Cenobites double-cross Kirsty and attempt to take her, she grabs the puzzle box from Julia's dead hands and banishes them by reversing the motions needed to open the puzzle box. Kirsty's boyfriend Steve arrives and they both escape the collapsing house.

Afterward, Kirsty throws the puzzle box onto a burning pyre.

She meets photographer Dean, who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby, who introduces fellow older models Gigi and Sarah, who are interested in her physical appearance and in her sexual experiences, which Jesse pretends to have had.

Jesse is signed by Roberta Hoffman, the owner of a modeling agency, who tells her to pretend that she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther. The shoot is successful, and Gigi and Sarah envy Jesse's youth. Jesse goes to a casting call for fashion designer Robert Sarno where Sarah is also present. Sarno pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse's beauty. Distraught, Sarah asks her how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse admits, ""It's everything,"" and Sarah lunges toward her, cutting Jesse's hand on the glass. Sarah sucks the blood from Jesse's hand and Jesse rushes back to her motel and faints, hallucinating as she sees abstract imagery.

At Sarno's fashion show, Gigi talks to Jesse about cosmetic surgery. As Jesse is closing the show, she has hallucinations of abstract triangular shapes and reflections of herself. After the show, Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar, where Sarno negatively contrasts Gigi's surgically-enhanced looks to Jesse's natural beauty. Dean finds the conversation unpleasant and attempts to leave with Jesse, who refuses, now espousing a narcissistic persona.

Jesse has a nightmare of being forced by Hank, the lecherous motel owner, to sexually swallow a knife. She wakes up to hear someone fidgeting with her door lock. She engages the deadbolt and hears the intruder break into the next room, assaulting the thirteen-year-old female occupant inside. Terrified, she calls Ruby, who invites Jesse to her home. Ruby makes sexual advances towards Jesse, who immediately rejects them. Jesse reveals to Ruby that she is a virgin, whereupon Ruby goes to her second job as a cosmetologist at a morgue and pleasures herself with a female corpse.

Ruby returns home, where Jesse encounters Gigi and Sarah, who, along with Ruby, chase Jesse, causing her to fall into a deep, empty pool, and the women butcher Jesse with knives and consume parts of her body, before bathing in her blood. Ruby is revealed to have occult tattoos. She lies in Jesse's unmarked grave, and later, nude, in her house, as a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals.

The next day, Gigi and Sarah attend one of Jack's shoots with another model named Annie. Jack is suddenly enthralled by Sarah and fires Annie. In the midst of the shoot, Gigi runs off set, suddenly ill. Sarah watches Gigi vomit up one of Jesse's eyeballs. She screams with regret, ""I need to get her out of me,"" and stabs herself with a pair of scissors. Sarah watches Gigi die and eats the regurgitated eyeball before returning to the shoot.

In the end credits' scene, a woman, whose face is not shown, walks alone in the Mojave Desert.

Jamie manages to convince Amelia's mother, Lauren, and a teenager named Doug, her school's present-day principal, to help her. Although Jamie manages to infiltrate a party hosted by Tiffany, she is unable to stop her murder. Using the trauma to bond with Pam, she infiltrates their group and convinces them to leave for the weekend, although this backfires; they end up at the cabin where Marisa was killed in the original timeline.

Upon returning to the present day, she finds that Pam is still alive. However, Jamie's intervention in the past has resulted in an alternate future in which her parents got together earlier than they had originally.

Their long-lost colleague, Agent Phillip Jeffries, materializes in the building and walks into Cole's office, where he rants about a meeting he witnessed involving mysterious spirits. A vision of these spirits—the Jumping Man, the Man from Another Place, BOB, and Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson—appears briefly before Jeffries vanishes. Sitting nearby, Agent Albert Rosenfield reports that Jeffries was never there and Desmond has disappeared. Cooper is sent to Deer Meadow to search for Desmond, but he learns nothing.

The Last Seven Days of Laura Palmer
One year later in Twin Peaks, high school homecoming queen Laura Palmer uses cocaine and cheats on her boyfriend Bobby Briggs with biker James Hurley. Discovering that pages are missing from her secret diary, she gives the rest of it to her agoraphobic friend Harold Smith for safekeeping.

Mrs. Chalfont and her grandson appear to Laura. They present a small framed picture for her wall, and warn her that the ""man behind the mask"" is in her bedroom. Laura runs home and sees BOB behind her dresser. She rushes outside in terror and sees her father, Leland, emerge from the house. That evening, Leland accusingly questions Laura about her romances and screams at her to wash her hands. At bedtime, he offers her a tearful apology.

After hanging the picture on her wall, Laura dreams about entering the Lodge. There, she sees Cooper and the Man from Another Place, who identifies himself as the arm and offers Teresa's ring to Laura. Cooper tells her not to take it. Laura sees Annie Blackburn next to her in bed, covered in blood. Annie tells Laura to write in her diary that ""the good Dale is in the Lodge and cannot leave"" and then disappears. Laura sees the ring in her hand, but when she wakes up, it is gone.

That night, Laura goes to the Roadhouse, a bar where she works as an underage prostitute. From there, Laura and her pimp Jacques Renault, along with two of their clients, relocate to another bar just over the border in Canada. Donna Hayward, Laura's best friend, is naive to prostitution and hard drug use. She follows Laura there and crashes the group. After seeing a drugged and topless Donna making out with her ""John"", Laura drags her off. She begs Donna not to become like her.

The next morning, Philip Gerard, the one-armed man possessed by the spirit MIKE, approaches Leland and Laura. He shows Teresa's ring to Laura while accosting Leland about canned corn. Leland remembers his affair with Teresa. He had asked Teresa to set up a foursome with her friends but fled after glimpsing Laura among them. Teresa realized who he was and plotted to blackmail him, so Leland murdered her. While Leland and MIKE yell, Laura becomes greatly disturbed and screams at them to stop. MIKE quickly drives away.

That night in a forest, Bobby and Laura wait for Jacques's drug contact. They are approached by Deer Meadow Deputy Cliff, who produces a package of white powder. He fumbles to draw a gun, but Bobby shoots first, killing Cliff. The next night, while Laura is high on cocaine, BOB comes through her window and rapes her. She asks, ""Who are you?"" and sees that BOB is her father.

Laura attends school in distress. Deciding she is using him for cocaine access, Bobby breaks up with her. Laura is increasingly erratic and disturbed. At night, she ends her relationship with James, jumps off his motorcycle and escapes to a cabin in the woods, where Jacques, Leo Johnson, and underage prostitute Ronette Pulaski are waiting. The four take cocaine and have sex. During it, Jacques ties Laura up and rapes her. Leland shows up and beats Jacques unconscious while Leo flees. Leland takes Laura and Ronette to an abandoned train car. Laura asks him if he is going to kill her. BOB tells her that he wants to be her. BOB pummels Ronette unconscious. MIKE, having tracked Leland there, rescues Ronette and tosses Teresa's ring into the train car. Laura wears it. Enraged, BOB kills Laura and sends her body, wrapped in plastic, floating down a river. He then passes into the Red Room, encountering MIKE and the Man from Another Place. Together, they demand ""garmonbozia"" (translated on-screen as ""pain and sorrow"") from BOB, as a separated Leland floats beside, unaware.

Epilogue
Laura's dead body is discovered by the residents of Twin Peaks. Agent Cooper comforts her in the Red Room. She sees her angel floating above and cries tears of joy.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Gender Based Violence**: The film prominently revolves around Laura Palmer's experiences with sexual assault, rape, and psychological abuse by BOB, who is later revealed to be her father, Leland Palmer.
2. **Female Sexuality**: Laura's work as an underage prostitute and her explorations and struggles with her sexuality are central themes in the movie.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

- **Adolescent girl**: Laura Palmer is a high school student (homecoming queen) grappling with severe personal and supernatural issues, positioning her firmly in the category of an adolescent girl.

### Monstrous Feminine:

- **Monstrous Feminine**: Laura is not explicitly portrayed as a monstrous feminine; rather, she is a victim of monstrous male figures (BOB/Leland). Therefore, she does not fit into Barbara Creed's specific archetypes of the monstrous feminine.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?

- **Dies**: Laura Palmer is murdered by her father, who is possessed by BOB, in the climax of the movie.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment:

- **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on Laura Palmer's victimization. Despite her moments of resistance and her complex personal agency, she is subjected to relentless psychological and physical threats and ultimately cannot escape from her abuser, leading to her death. The narrative emphasizes her immediate survival and victimhood rather than empowerment.",2,2,2,1,1,1
The Descent,2005,Neil Marshall,M,Shauna Macdonald,F,"After a tragic accident, six friends reunite for a caving expedition. Their adventure soon goes horribly wrong when a collapse traps them deep underground and they find themselves pursued by bloodthirsty creatures. As their friendships deteriorate, they find themselves in a desperate struggle to survive the creatures and each other.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Descent,"After thrill-seeking friends Sarah, Juno, and Beth go whitewater rafting, Sarah, her husband Paul, and their daughter Jessica, are involved in a car crash when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives.

One year later, Sarah, Juno, and Beth, as well as friends Sam, Rebecca, and newcomer Holly reunite at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina for a spelunking adventure. They later hike up to a mountain cave entrance and descend. After they move through a narrow passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits that she has led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system that they had originally planned to visit, making rescue impossible.

The group presses forward with hopes of finding an exit, they discover aged climbing equipment and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists. Holly, thinking she sees sunlight, runs ahead, but she falls down a hole and breaks her leg. As the others help Holly, Sarah wanders off and observes a pale, humanoid creature drinking at a pool before it scampers away. Later, the group comes across a den of animal bones and is suddenly attacked by a creature they name a ""crawler"". Holly is killed when a crawler attacks and bites through her throat. Sarah runs and falls down a hole, where she is knocked unconscious. Juno, trying to prevent Holly's body from being dragged away, kills a crawler with her pickaxe but then, startled and in shock, she accidentally strikes Beth through the neck. Beth collapses with Juno's pendant in her hand and begs Juno not to leave her, but a traumatized Juno flees.

Sarah awakens to find herself in a den of human and animal carcasses, witnessing Holly's body being mauled and eaten by crawlers. Juno discovers cave markings from previous explorers that point to a specific path through the caves. Juno locates Sam and Rebecca. Sam has deduced that the crawlers are blind and rely on sound to hunt. Juno tells them about the markings, but she will not leave without Sarah. Sarah encounters Beth, who tells her that Juno attacked, and then abandoned her. Beth gives Juno's pendant to Sarah, telling her it is a gift from Paul, and Sarah realizes that Juno and Paul had an affair before his death. Beth begs Sarah for a mercy killing, which Sarah reluctantly does by bashing her head in with a rock. Sarah then encounters several crawlers and manages to kill them all, falling into a blood-filled pond in the process and emerging covered in blood.

Elsewhere, Juno, Sam, and Rebecca are pursued by a large group of crawlers. They reach a chasm. Sam tries to climb across, but a crawler scaling the ceiling attacks and rips out her throat. Sam stabs it then bleeds to death in front of Juno and Rebecca. Rebecca is then dragged away and eaten alive as Juno escapes. Juno encounters Sarah and lies to her about seeing Beth die. After defeating a group of crawlers close to the exit, Sarah confronts Juno, revealing the pendant and her knowledge of Beth's fate and the affair with Paul. Sarah strikes Juno in the leg with a pickaxe and leaves her to die as a swarm of crawlers approaches. Juno is last heard screaming as Sarah escapes. Sarah falls down a hole and is rendered unconscious.

When she awakens, she sees sunlight and clambers up a slope covered in bones to escape the cave. After exhaustedly running to her car, she speeds out of the woods. She pulls over to the side of the road, breaking down in tears. After a truck passes her, she vomits out the window. When she sits up, she sees a hallucination of a bloodied Juno sitting next to her and screams. Sarah suddenly awakens, back in the cave. She sees a vision of her dead daughter Jessica, and smiles as the shrieks of crawlers grow closer.",,"### Movie Title: The Descent

#### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood**: The protagonist, Sarah, suffers the loss of her daughter Jessica in a car crash at the start of the movie. Her hallucination of her dead daughter at the end underscores the ongoing impact of motherhood and loss on her psyche.
2. **Gender-Based Violence**: The film features intense physical violence, including an incident where Juno accidentally kills Beth with a pickaxe. Although not overtly sexual, the violent acts reflect themes of betrayal and survival within the all-female group, which can be seen as a metaphor for the competitive and sometimes hostile dynamics women may face.

#### Role of the Main Protagonist:
- **Other**: Sarah does not fit neatly into the traditional roles related to femininity or vulnerability listed. She is neither fulfilling a caretaking role nor involved in professions related to beauty or perfection. Instead, she is a thrill-seeker and adventurer who experiences extreme psychological and physical challenges.

#### Monstrous Feminine:
- **Monstrous Feminine**: Sarah can be seen as an embodiment of the ""monstrous feminine"" as per Barbara Creed's definition. Her transformation from a grieving mother to a blood-covered survivor in the cave aligns with the archetype. She even becomes a castrator, metaphorically, when she exacts revenge on Juno by striking her, thus leaving her to die in the cave.

#### Protagonist's Fate:
- **Dies**: At the end of the movie, Sarah is revealed to still be in the cave, having hallucinated her escape. Given the impending approach of the crawlers, it is implied that she does not survive.

#### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
- **Victimization**: The story leans more towards female victimization. While Sarah does exhibit moments of strength and resilience, she ultimately does not gain lasting agency or autonomy. The ongoing psychological and physical threats dominate her experience, culminating in a hallucinatory escape that implies her doom rather than empowerment. The narrative focuses more on her immediate survival and inevitable succumbing to the caves' horrors, rather than her overcoming them in a meaningful way.",1,5,1,1,1,1
Lisa Frankenstein,2024,Zelda Williams,F,Kathryn Newton,F,"In 1989, a misunderstood teenager has a high school crush — who just happens to be a handsome corpse! After a set of playfully horrific circumstances bring him back to life, the two embark on a murderous journey to find love, happiness…and a few missing body parts along the way.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Frankenstein,"In 1989, teenage Lisa Swallows is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of her mother, who was killed by an axe murderer two years earlier. Her father Dale has since remarried a woman named Janet, who also has a daughter from a previous marriage, Taffy. Lisa spends much of her time at a local cemetery.

Lisa heads to a party with Taffy, who encourages her to socialise. She has an awkward encounter with Michael, her crush, and is accidentally drugged by one of his friends. She is later sexually harassed by her lab partner Doug. Lisa returns to the cemetery and speaks to the grave of a young man who died in 1837; a pianist who had fallen in love with a woman in his own time before she left him for another man, and was later killed by a lightning strike. A bolt of lightning strikes his grave after Lisa leaves, and the man is brought back to life as a zombie.

The man (referred to as “The Creature” in the film’s credits) breaks into the house. Lisa is initially terrified, but eventually recognizes him as the man whose grave she dotes on, and decides to hide him in her closet. The Creature is mute, covered in debris, and missing multiple body parts.

Lisa claims that a burglar broke in to explain the mess made by the Creature, but Janet claims she is making it up for attention. When she threatens to send Lisa to an asylum, the Creature kills Janet and cuts off her ear before the two dump Janet's body in the cemetery. Lisa sews Janet's ear onto the Creature, but discovers that the parts will not work without a current. They use Taffy's tanning bed to revive the ear, which also restores the Creature to a more human appearance. Lisa then lures Doug to the cemetery so that she can cut off his hand for the Creature. The Creature kills Doug and hides his body with Janet's. Once again able to play the piano, the Creature starts to bond with Lisa.

The police start to investigate Janet's and Doug's disappearances. Lisa is implicated but refuses to cooperate with the investigation. Lisa goes to find Michael, but she finds him in bed with Taffy and is devastated. The Creature enters and chops off Michael's penis. The Creature prepares to attack Taffy, but Lisa stops him and follows him as he flees to the cemetery. Lisa gives Taffy her mother's rosary as a token of appreciation for her kindness and sympathy, before pursuing the Creature into the woods.

Lisa confronts the Creature, who admits he loves her. They leave the cemetery after throwing an officer into a grave. Lisa attaches Michael's penis to the Creature so they can have sex. Afterwards, Lisa convinces the Creature to electrocute her in the tanning bed to avoid being arrested. The Creature does as she asked, causing Lisa to burn to death.

Dale and Taffy later visit Lisa's grave. Taffy is disturbed to discover an inscription has been added to Lisa's headstone, ""Beloved Wife"", which has been damaged by lightning. We then see the Creature sitting on a bench, reading aloud Percy Shelley's poem, O Mary Dear. A resurrected Lisa lies in his lap and opens her eyes.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1) **Motherhood**: Although motherhood is not a primary theme in the narrative, Lisa's grieving process over her mother's death plays a crucial role in her motivations and actions throughout the movie.
2) **Gender-Based Violence**: Lisa faces multiple instances of gender-based violence, including sexual harassment and being threatened to be sent to an asylum for acting out.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
1) **Adolescent Girl**: Lisa Swallows is clearly identified as a teenage girl throughout the narrative.

### Main Protagonist as a Monster:
1) **Monstrous Feminine**: Lisa can be seen as embodying aspects of the ""monstrous feminine."" She engages in egregious behaviors such as mutilating and killing others to benefit The Creature. In her obsession and ultimate plan to resurrect herself, elements like the ""monstrous womb"" and ""witch"" could be identified.

### Protagonist's Fate:
1) **Dies**: Lisa dies by electrocution in the tanning bed as she intended, although she is resurrected by the end of the film.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
1) **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on Lisa's victimization, as she is subjected to psychological and physical threats nearly from the beginning of the movie. Her actions are motivated out of desperation and a refusal to assimilate into a ""normal"" life rather than pursuing personal empowerment.

Hush,2016,Mike Flanagan,M,Kate Siegel,F,A deaf woman is stalked by a psychotic killer in her secluded home.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(2016_film),"Deaf-mute horror author Maddie Young lost her abilities to hear and speak after contracting bacterial meningitis at age 13. The disease caused hearing loss and temporary vocal cord paresis which became permanent after unsuccessful surgery.

Hoping to advance her writing career following her publication of the novel Midnight Mass and receiving international critical acclaim, Maddie leaves New York City and lives an isolated life in the woods with her white cat. Her friend Sarah visits her one evening to return a copy of her book, and they talk about her isolation and Sarah's desire to learn more sign language. Later that night, a masked killer with a crossbow attacks Sarah and chases her to Maddie's house. A bloodied Sarah bangs on the door shouting for help; she goes unnoticed by Maddie (due to the fact that she's deaf) and the killer stabs Sarah in the stomach 13 times, killing her.

The killer quickly deduces that Maddie is deaf and decides to make her another victim. He sneaks into her house and steals her phone, which he then uses to take pictures of her and sends them to her. Maddie realizes she is being stalked and tries to call the police, but the killer cuts the power and punctures the tires on her car to prevent escape. Maddie writes ""won't tell, didn't see face, boyfriend coming home"" on the glass panel door with her lipstick. The killer responds by taking off his mask and revealing his face and—upon learning she can read lips—taunts her with the threat of waiting to break in. He then uses Sarah's corpse to knock on the window. Maddie uses her car keys to trigger her car alarm in an attempt to distract the killer so she can retrieve Sarah's phone from her corpse's pocket, but is caught by him before she can grab it and quickly locks herself back inside.

While attempting to escape through the second-story window, Maddie is shot in the leg by the killer with a crossbow bolt, but she manages to knock him off the roof and steal the weapon. Sarah's boyfriend, John, arrives at Maddie's house looking for Sarah. The killer poses as a police officer responding to a call, but John grows suspicious of him. He plans to attack the killer from behind with a rock, but Maddie, attempting to draw John's attention to herself, unintentionally distracts him by banging on the window, allowing the killer to stab him in the neck. As John bleeds to death, he puts the killer in a chokehold to buy Maddie enough time to escape, but she realizes that she will either be caught or bleed to death and her only chance for survival is to kill her assailant.

Outside, the killer is about to kill Maddie's cat with his knife, but she shoots him in the shoulder with the crossbow. As Maddie retreats into the house and sticks her hand out to get a crossbow arrow, the killer slams the sliding door on her wrist and crushes her hand beneath his boot. He allows Maddie to pull her mangled hand inside and close and lock the door. When he threatens to enter the house, Maddie writes ""do it, coward"" on the door with her own blood. As the killer begins bashing the door in with a tire iron, Maddie uses her laptop to type up a description of the man and a message to her family. She then locks herself in her bathroom, armed with a knife.

Failing to break through the door, the killer opts to jump through the bathroom skylight. Maddie does not notice him until he breathes against her neck. She narrowly avoids his attack and impales his knee. He follows her into the kitchen, where she blasts his face with insecticide and uses her visual smoke alarm to disorient him. He begins strangling her, but she finally kills him when she stabs him in the neck with a corkscrew. Maddie retrieves her cell phone from the man's body and dials 9-1-1. As she sits on her porch steps while the police approach her, Maddie pets her cat and smiles.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Other** - The themes in *Hush* revolve around isolation and survival rather than specifically addressing traditional categories related to womanhood like motherhood, gender-based violence, female sexuality, or beauty and aging.
2. **Other** - Another theme can be self-reliance and resilience, as Maddie's deafness offers a unique twist on the “final girl” trope, emphasizing her capabilities in overcoming her attacker.

### Role of Main Protagonist:
1. **Other** - Maddie is neither a mother, housewife, adolescent girl, nor is she in a profession related to beauty, perfection, or caretaking. She is a horror author living in isolation, which strays from traditional female roles but emphasizes her strength and autonomy.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?
1. **Other** - Maddie is not portrayed as a monster in *Hush*. She is primarily depicted as a victim who must survive a brutal attack. Her deafness and her fight for survival do not fit into Barbara Creed's categories of the monstrous-feminine.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?
1. **Survives** - Maddie survives the ordeal and is seen sitting on her porch steps as the police approach.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
1. **Empowerment** - Despite being targeted by a killer, Maddie showcases a lot of resourcefulness, resilience, and autonomy throughout the movie. Her survival and proactive measures to protect herself highlight female empowerment, as she gains control over her own narrative and overcomes significant physical and psychological threats.",5,5,2,2,2,1
Night of the Living Dead,1968,George A. Romero,M,Judith O'Dea,F,A group of people try to survive an attack of bloodthirsty zombies while trapped in a rural Pennsylvania farmhouse.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Living_Dead,"Siblings Barbra and Johnny drive to a cemetery in rural Pennsylvania to visit their father's grave, where a pale man in a tattered suit kills Johnny and attacks Barbra. She flees to a nearby farmhouse but finds the resident's corpse lying half-eaten on the stairs. A growing horde of ghouls soon surround the house as a stranger, Ben, arrives and initially mistakes Barbra for the homeowner. After driving back several ghouls, he boards the windows and doors. While searching the home for supplies, he locates a lever-action rifle.

A nearly catatonic Barbra is surprised to find people already taking shelter in the home's cellar. Harry, his wife Helen, and their young daughter Karen fled there after a group of the same monsters overturned their car and bit Karen on the arm, leaving her seriously ill. A couple, Tom and Judy, took shelter after hearing an emergency broadcast about a series of brutal killings. Tom and Ben secure the farmhouse while Harry protests that it is unsafe aboveground before returning to the cellar. Ghouls continue to besiege the farmhouse in increasing numbers.

The refugees listen to radio and television reports of an army of cannibalistic corpses committing mass murder across the East Coast of the United States and of the posses of armed men patrolling the countryside to exterminate the living dead. Reports confirm that the ghouls can die again from heavy blows to the head, bullets to the brain, or being burned. Various rescue centers offer refuge and safety, and scientists theorize that radiation from an exploding space probe returning from Venus caused the reanimations.

Ben devises a plan to obtain medical supplies for Karen and transport the group to a rescue center by refueling his truck at a pump on the farm. Ben, Tom, and Judy drive there together, holding the ghouls off with torches and Molotov cocktails. However, the gas from the pump spills and causes the truck to catch fire and explode, killing Tom and Judy. Ben returns and breaks down the door when Harry does not let him in.

The remaining survivors attempt to figure a way out. They pause their discussion to watch the 3 a.m. news update until the power cuts out. The ghouls soon break through the doors and windows of the unlit home. In the chaos, Harry grabs Ben's gun but is disarmed and shot by Ben. Harry staggers down to the cellar and dies next to his daughter.

Karen dies from her injuries, becomes a ghoul, and eats her father's remains. She stabs her mother to death with a masonry trowel. Barbra tries to help Ben keep the ghouls out, but a reanimated Johnny drags her away. As the horde breaks in, Ben takes refuge in the cellar, where he shoots Harry's and Helen's ghouls.

In the morning, an armed posse arrives to dispatch the remaining ghouls. Awoken by their gunfire and sirens, Ben emerges from the cellar, but they shoot him, mistaking Ben for a ghoul. His body is thrown onto a bonfire and burned with the rest of the ghouls.","Since its release, many critics and film historians have interpreted Night of the Living Dead as a subversive film that critiques 1960s American society, international Cold War politics and domestic racism.[65] Film historian Robin Wood organized ""The American Nightmare""—a sixty-film retrospective combining screenings and director interviews to frame horror in terms of oppression and repression—for the 1979 Toronto International Film Festival. His essay from the program notes, ""An Introduction to the American Horror Film"", was highly influential, especially in film criticism where horror as a genre had not previously been considered a topic for serious analysis.[223][224] Wood interprets notable horror films including Night through a psychoanalytic framework.[225] He discusses how traits deemed unacceptable are repressed on the personal level or when not repressed, oppressed on the societal level.[225] He identifies repressed taboos and othered groups as the psychological basis for horror monsters.[225] Wood and later critics used this framework to discuss Night as a commentary on repressed sexuality, the marginalized groups of 1960s America, and the disruption to societal norms resulting from the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War.[226][227]

Elliot Stein of The Village Voice sees the film as an ardent critique of American involvement in the Vietnam War, arguing that it ""was not set in Transylvania, but Pennsylvania – this was Middle America at war, and the zombie carnage seemed a grotesque echo of the conflict then raging in Vietnam"".[228] Film historian Sumiko Higashi concurs, arguing that Night of the Living Dead draws from the visual vocabulary the media used to report on the war, noting especially that the photographs of the napalm girl and the execution of Nguyễn Văn Lém would be fresh in the minds of the film's creators and audience.[229] She points to aspects of the Vietnam War paralleled in the film: grainy black-and-white newsreels, search and destroy operations, helicopters, and graphic carnage.[230] In 1968, the news was still broadcast in black and white, and the graphic photographs that appear during the closing credits resemble the contemporary Vietnam War photojournalism.[65]

Critics have compared the shooting of the film's black protagonist to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.[65][231][232] Stein explains, ""In this first-ever subversive horror movie, the resourceful black hero survives the zombies only to be surprised by a redneck posse"".[228] In 2018, on the film's 50th anniversary, Mark Lager of CineAction noted a clear parallel between the killing and destruction of Ben's body by white police and the violence directed at African Americans during the civil rights movement. Lager described it as a more honest exploration of 1960s America than anything produced by Hollywood.[233]

Night shows influence from Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds.[213] In both films, a small group takes refuge in an isolated house and attempts to fend off an inexplicable attack.[234] Film historian Robin Wood comments that the zombies and birds both function as projections of the familial tensions.[235] The living dead appear during a familial dispute at the cemetery, and the danger escalates as familial resent builds in the farmhouse.[236] Professor of Film Studies Carter Soles argues that the films offer different perspectives on an ""environmental apocalypse"".[237] Hitchcock's birds were a force of nature, but Romero's zombies were a direct product of human actions. Soles argues that this reflects changing cultural attitudes, especially after the 1962 environmental science book Silent Spring made Americans aware of harm done by the pesticide DDT.[238]

Film historian Gregory Waller identifies broad-ranging critiques of American institutions including the nuclear family, private homes, media, government, and ""the entire mechanism of civil defense"".[239] Film historian Linda Badley explains that the film was so horrifying because the monsters were not creatures from outer space or some exotic environment, but rather that ""They're us.""[240] In the 2009 documentary film Nightmares in Red, White and Blue, the zombies in the film are compared to the ""silent majority"" of the U.S. in the late 1960s.","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Motherhood**: Helen and Harry are parents to a young daughter, Karen, whose condition deteriorates after being bitten by a zombie and who ultimately becomes a ghoul. Helen's protective instincts and tragic fate highlight the themes of motherhood, especially under extreme duress.
2. **Gender-based violence**: Barbra undergoes physical assault by the ghouls, starting with her brother's death and later getting dragged away by her reanimated brother. Helen also faces extreme physical danger, ultimately getting stabbed to death by her own daughter who has become a ghoul.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

1. Barbra primarily fits into the category of **Adolescent girl** based on her initial catatonic state and helplessness, often requiring protection from the male characters.
2. Helen fits into the **Mother or housewife** category due to her role as a mother protecting her daughter Karen, and her domestic activities within the context of the farmhouse (taking care of the family in a crisis).

### Monstrous-Feminine Analysis:

1. **Monstrous feminine**: Karen embodies the ""monstrous child"" concept, turning into a ghoul, eating her father's remains, and killing her mother with a trowel. This aligns with Creed’s concept of the ""monstrous womb"" and ""monstrous mother.""

### Fate of the Female Protagonist:

1. **Barbra dies** as she is dragged away by her reanimated brother after trying to help defend the house.
2. **Helen dies** after being stabbed to death by her transformed daughter, Karen.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment:

1. **Victimization**: Both Barbra and Helen are subjected to physical threats and violence for most of the movie's runtime. They lack significant agency or autonomy and are more about immediate survival rather than overcoming their circumstances or gaining control. This places the narrative more on the victimization side.

Crimson Peak,2015,Guillermo del Toro,M,Mia Wasikowska,F,"In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider. Trying to escape the ghosts of her past, she is swept away to a house that breathes, bleeds… and remembers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimson_Peak,"In 1887 Buffalo, New York, American heiress Edith Cushing, daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing, is visited by her mother's ghost who warns, ""Beware of Crimson Peak.""

In 1901, Edith is now a budding author, and meets English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe and his sister, Lucille. Thomas seeks investors for his invention, a digging machine to revive his family's clay mines, but Mr. Cushing rejects his proposal. Thomas and Edith become romantically attached, leading her father to hire a private detective who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpe siblings. Mr. Cushing bribes them to leave America, forcing Thomas to ""break Edith's heart"" by disparaging her and her novel.

Thomas returns Edith's manuscript with a letter explaining his actions, and they reconcile. Mr. Cushing is brutally murdered, raising the suspicions of Edith's childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael. Thomas marries Edith — giving her a ring taken from Lucille — and they arrive at Allerdale Hall, the Sharpes' dilapidated Cumberland mansion, which is sinking into the red clay mine below. Lucille plies Edith with tea made from ""firethorn berries"" and Thomas persuades her to put her father's fortune toward his machine.

Edith begins to notice Thomas' absence from their shared bedroom during the night. She is plagued by nightmares and continually visited by gruesome red ghosts around Allerdale, one of which tricks her into opening a closet, where she discovers wax phonograph cylinders, before chasing her into the cellars, where she finds a locked trunk engraved with the name ""Enola"". Soon after this Edith gets told that the estate is referred to as ""Crimson Peak"" due to the warm red clay seeping through the winter snow. Thomas takes Edith on a trip to the local post office for some fresh air after Edith demands to leave, where she receives a letter addressed to E. Sharpe. Snowed in for the night, they finally make love, which Lucille is infuriated to learn.

Edith steals a key from Lucille bearing the inscription ""Enola"" and unlocks the trunk to find a gramophone and secret documents. Using the gramophone to listen to the audio recordings on the wax cylinders, and while reading the paper documents, Edith learns that Thomas previously married three other wealthy women — including Enola Sciotti, the letter’s intended recipient — and that Lucille has been poisoning Edith with tea as part of the siblings' ""marriage and murder"" scheme to finance Thomas' inventions. Edith confronts her husband and sister-in-law, catching them in an incestuous embrace, and Lucille pushes her from a balcony.

Alan has learned what Mr. Cushing uncovered about the Sharpes: Thomas's multiple marriages and Lucille's time in a mental institution. He travels to Allerdale Hall to rescue Edith, arriving just after she has been pushed. Tending to her injuries, Alan prepares to leave with Edith, but Lucille stabs him and demands that Thomas finish the job. Thomas, instead, inflicts a nonfatal stab wound to Alan before hiding him in the cellar.

Lucille forces Edith to sign a transfer deed granting the Sharpes ownership of her estate, and confesses to having murdered Thomas’ previous wives and having borne a child with Thomas that soon died — these are the ghosts who have appeared to Edith. Lucille admits to murdering Edith's father, as well as her own mother when she discovered Lucille and Thomas' sexual relationship. Edith stabs Lucille with her pen and flees, but is confronted by Thomas, who has truly fallen in love with her. He burns the deed and begs his sister to join him and Edith in a new life together, but an enraged Lucille stabs him to death. She pursues Edith with the cleaver she used to kill her mother, but is halted by Thomas' ghost, allowing Edith to kill her with a shovel. Edith silently bids Thomas farewell before he vanishes.

Edith and Alan are rescued by the villagers, and Lucille becomes the ghost of Allerdale Hall, playing her piano for eternity.

The end credits imply that Edith has written a novel based on her experiences, titled Crimson Peak.

Some time later, David Allen and his girlfriend Natalie arrive at the cabin with their dog Grandpa, where they meet his estranged younger sister Mia and their friends Eric and Olivia. The group plans to stay in the cabin while Mia overcomes her heroin addiction. Mia begins having withdrawal symptoms. David discovers that the cabin's cellar is littered with rotting cat corpses, a worn double-barrel shotgun, and a book called the Naturom Demonto.

Eric reads an incantation from the book, awakening a malevolent force. Mia begins seeing a demonic doppelgänger of herself in the woods. She steals Eric's Ford Taurus Wagon to leave but crashes into a pond. The force chases her into the woods, where vines trap her. Mia's doppelgänger possesses her via the vines.

David finds Grandpa beaten to death with a hammer and discovers Mia scalding herself in the shower with boiling water. That night, a possessed Mia wounds David with the shotgun and vomits onto Olivia's face before Eric locks her in the basement. A possessed Olivia mutilates her face and stabs Eric with a hypodermic needle before he bludgeons her to death. Mia lures Natalie into the cellar and bites her hand before slicing her own tongue. David helps Natalie escape.

Eric explains that per the book, the ""Taker of Souls"" must claim five souls to unleash the ""Abomination"". Natalie's arm becomes possessed and she amputates it with an electric knife,causing a power outage. Mia must be ""purified"" by live burial, dismemberment, or burning. The now-possessed Natalie attacks the pair with a nail gun, but David shoots her other arm off; Natalie bleeds to death from her injury.

David begins dousing the cabin in gasoline, but decides to bury Mia instead. He digs a grave but Mia attempts to drown him, and Eric is fatally stabbed saving him. David sedates and buries Mia but after hearing her heartbeat stop, digs her back up and attempts to resuscitate her with a homemade defilibrator. He finds Mia alive and enters the cabin to retrieve his car keys, but Eric's possessed corpse stabs him. David shoots a gasoline can, killing himself and Eric.

With David's death being the fifth claimed soul, blood begins to rain from the sky and the Abomination attacks Mia as her demonic doppelgänger. Mia severs the Abomination's legs with a chainsaw, but it overturns David's Jeep Wrangler onto her left arm, crushing it in the process. After Mia’s hand gets torn off from her freeing herself, she bisects the Abomination's head with a chainsaw before it sinks back into the ground and the rain stops. An exhausted Mia leaves, unaware the Naturom Demonto is still intact.

As a newspaper reporter, Rachel Keller was naturally skeptical of the story, until four teenagers all met with mysterious deaths exactly one week after watching just such a tape. Allowing her investigative curiosity to get the better of her, Rachel tracks down the video... and watches it. Now she has just seven days to unravel the mystery of the Ring.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(2002_film),"Teenage girls Katie and Becca discuss an urban legend about a cursed videotape that causes whoever views it to die in one week. That night, Katie, who viewed it one week ago, is killed by an unseen force.

At Katie's funeral, her mother asks her sister Rachel, a Seattle-based journalist, to investigate her daughter's death. Rachel discovers that Katie's friends all died in bizarre accidents at the same time as Katie's death. Rachel visits the Shelter Mountain Inn, where Katie and her friends saw the tape. She finds and views the tape; it contains strange and frightening imagery. She then receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers, ""Seven days"". Though initially skeptical, Rachel quickly begins to experience supernatural occurrences linked to the tape.

Rachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-husband Noah. He views the tape and Rachel makes him a copy. She identifies a woman on the tape: horse breeder Anna Morgan, who committed suicide after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel and Noah's 8-year-old young son Aidan sees the tape. Aidan also possesses supernatural abilities, which he uses to help with Rachel's investigation.

Rachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard, while Noah travels to Gale Psychiatric Hospital to view Anna's medical files. Rachel discovers that Anna had adopted a girl, Samara, who possessed the ability to psychically etch images onto objects and into people's minds, tormenting her parents and their horses. Noah finds a psychiatric file on Samara that mentions a terrifying video record last seen by Richard.

Returning to the Morgan home, Rachel finds a fake birth certificate proving that Samara is not the biological child of Richard and Anna. She also discovers the missing video, in which Samara explains her powers during a therapy session. Richard insists that Samara is evil and commits suicide by electrocuting himself. Noah and Rachel find a loft in the barn, which the Morgans used to isolate Samara from themselves and the outside world. There is an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.

They return to Shelter Mountain Inn, led to a well beneath the floorboards. Rachel falls inside and experiences a vision of Anna dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for one week. Samara's body surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued, they arrange a proper burial for Samara.

Back home, Aidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's week is up; Samara's ghost crawls out of his TV screen and kills him. Initially unable to deduce why she was spared, Rachel realizes that the tape seen by Noah was a copy she had created. Rachel saves Aidan by having him make another copy to show someone else.

Cloverfield,2008,Matt Reeves,M,Lizzy Caplan,F,"Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloverfield,"The footage from a personal camcorder is recovered by the U.S. Department of Defense in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"", bearing a disclaimer stating multiple sightings of a case designated ""Cloverfield"".

The camera contains two sets of recordings, mixed together. The earlier footage, recorded on April 27, 2008, shows Robert ""Rob"" Hawkins waking up with Elizabeth ""Beth"" McIntyre in her father's apartment above Columbus Circle before embarking on a date across New York City and Coney Island.

On May 22, 2008, Rob's brother Jason and Jason's girlfriend Lily Ford, throw a farewell party, celebrating Rob's new job. Jason gets Rob's best friend, Hudson ""Hud"" Platt, to film testimonials for Rob during the party. Beth, whose feelings are hurt because Rob never called her back after their one night together, brings another man to the party. Beth and Rob argue, and she leaves shortly before a massive earthquake occurs, causing a brief citywide power outage; the local news reports a capsized oil tanker near Liberty Island. From the roof, the partygoers witness an explosion in the distance and flee as flaming debris flies in their direction.

As the partygoers leave the building, the severed head of the Statue of Liberty is hurled into the street. In the chaos, Hud records an enormous creature several blocks away collapsing the Woolworth Building before taking cover in a convenience store. When the group attempts to evacuate Manhattan, the creature's tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller parasitic creatures that fall off its body.

Rob receives a message from Beth, who is trapped in her apartment at the Time Warner Center. Rob, followed by Hud, Lily, and Marlena Diamond, venture into Midtown Manhattan to rescue her. They find themselves in a battle between the creature and military, run into the subway, and are attacked by the parasites. While saving Hud, Marlena is bitten by one of the creatures. The four escape the subway and enter an underground mall where they are found by soldiers and taken to a command center nearby. When Marlena begins to bleed from her eyes, she is forcibly taken to a field hospital and explodes.

Rob, still intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military commanders to let them go. He is informed when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan to kill the monster. The surviving group travels to Beth's apartment building leaning on a neighboring skyscraper. After crossing roofs from the other building, the group finds Beth impaled on exposed rebar. They free her and make their way to the evacuation site at Grand Central Terminal, where they encounter the creature again.

Lily is first rushed into a first helicopter to escape before Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being heavily bombed. The creature remains unfazed and lunges out of the smoke, hitting the second helicopter, and causing it to crash in Central Park, killing all the occupants except Rob, Beth, and Hud.

Fifteen minutes before the Hammer Down Protocol commences, the trio regains consciousness and attempts to flee; Hud turns back to retrieve the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch. As air raid sirens blare, the bombing starts. Rob and Beth each provide their last testimony of the day's events. The bridge begins to crumble, and the camera is knocked out of Rob's hand and buried beneath the rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just as the bombs explode, and the camera freezing up before the footage cuts.

The film ends with the finale of Rob and Beth's trip to Coney Island a month earlier. Unseen by them, an indiscernible object falls from the sky and into the ocean before the camera cuts off.

After the credits, a voice can be heard saying, ""Help us..."" When played in reverse, it says, ""It's still alive.""",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

Without the specific ""Wiki Themes"" column for additional insights, I'm limited to the plot alone. Based on the given plot, the film includes:

- **Gender Based Violence:** The chaos and physical threats that are prevalent throughout the movie can be seen as a metaphor for gender-based violence, with female characters like Beth and Marlena being particularly vulnerable in a violently shifting environment.
  
- **Other:** The plot more prominently deals with themes of survival and rescue in the face of a massive, uncontrollable threat rather than focusing explicitly on traditional themes of womanhood like motherhood or female sexuality. It might also touch on themes of **Disaster and Human Resilience**.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

The primary main protagonist role in terms of traditional female roles would be:

- **Other:** Beth doesn't fit neatly into the predefined categories (mother, adolescent girl, professional related to beauty or caretaking). She appears to be a young woman in a personal crisis who becomes a focal point as the male protagonist, Rob, works to rescue her. Her role is less defined by traditional femininity roles and more by her position as someone needing rescue.

### Monstrous Feminine:

Beth is not portrayed as a monstrous feminine figure. 

- **Other:** The monstrous entity in ""Cloverfield"" is an external creature, not linked to any conceptualizations of monstrosity tied specifically to feminine characteristics.

### Female Protagonist's Fate:

Beth's fate at the end of the movie, along with Rob's, is a bit ambiguous but can be interpreted as:

- **Dies:** While the explicit final moments are not shown, the implication is that the bombing of Manhattan likely results in the deaths of both characters.

### Story Focus: Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:

Based on the plot description:

- **Victimization:** Beth is primarily a victim who needs to be rescued and subjected to various threats without gaining significant agency. The story mainly revolves around her immediate survival and the efforts of the male protagonist to rescue her. There isn't a strong element of her gaining control or autonomy over the situation.

### Summary:
- **Themes Related to Womanhood:** Gender Based Violence, Other (Disaster and Human Resilience)
- **Role of the Main Protagonist:** Other (a young woman in a personal crisis)
- **Monstrous Feminine:** Other
- **Fate:** Dies
- **Story Focus:** Victimization",2,5,2,1,2,1

The firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment. Ángela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, Álex and Manu, to the apartment building on Rambla de Catalunya. The old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the police officers, biting his neck. The crew find that the police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside.

As the residents begin to panic, Álex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase and critically injured. Mrs. Izquierdo kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. Ángela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents. One of them is a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Mari Carmen claims she has tonsillitis, and says her dog, Max, is at the vet. A health inspector in a hazmat suit arrives to help but the injured become extremely aggressive. The health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to rabies; the disease was traced back to a dog in the building, and Ángela realizes it must be Max. Jennifer, now infected, bites her mother's face and flees. Sergio handcuffs Mari to the stairs. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio. The infected break down the warehouse door that they were locked in and more of the residents are bitten and infected.

Ángela, Pablo, and Manu, the remaining three survivors, set out to find a key that will allow them to escape the building via a large drain in the basement. Manu is bitten, forcing Ángela and Pablo to take refuge in the penthouse. They discover a tape recorder that explains that the penthouse owner, an agent of the Vatican, was charged with the task of isolating an enzyme carried by a young Portuguese girl named Tristana Medeiros, whose symptoms suggest a demonic possession. The enzyme mutated and became contagious. The agent sealed Tristana in the house to die.

An infected boy damages Pablo's camera and he activates the night vision. A now-ghoulish Tristana emerges and searches the penthouse for food. Pablo is killed by Tristana. Seeing Tristana eating him, Ángela panics and drops the camera. She is then dragged into the darkness screaming.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Dies**: The movie concludes with Ángela being dragged into the darkness, implying her death.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment

After reuniting the severed hand of Sarah Fier with the rest of her corpse, Deena has a vision showing the events of 1666 from the perspective of Sarah Fier. She lives with her father George and brother Henry in Union, the original settlement before it was divided into Sunnyvale and Shadyside.

One night, Sarah and her friends Hannah Miller and Lizzie meet a reclusive widow to gather potent berries for a party, where Sarah stumbles on a book of black magic. The group joins Isaac and Abigail at the party where Sarah and Hannah are harassed by Caleb. The two run off and start kissing, unknowingly seen by Mad Thomas. The next day, Pastor Cyrus Miller begins to act strange, as the town's food and water supply are poisoned. Sarah confides in Solomon Goode and wonders if she is responsible for the town's bad luck. The town then discovers that Pastor Miller has murdered twelve children in the chapel, including Abigail's sister Constance, and Sarah’s brother Henry. Sarah is attacked by Pastor Miller before he is killed by Solomon. That night, a town meeting is held at which the townspeople decide that witchcraft is the cause of the events, and Caleb claims that Sarah and Hannah are the witches responsible. Hannah is captured while Sarah escapes and the town declares that Hannah will be executed at dawn.

Sarah sneaks into the chapel where Hannah is confined and the two profess their love. Sarah decides to retrieve the widow's book and use it to make a deal with the devil and save Hannah, but she discovers that the book is gone and the widow murdered. She flees to Solomon's house and hides after he is ambushed by men hunting her. While hiding, she finds tunnels under his house, discovering a ritual as well as the widow's book. Solomon reveals he took the book to make a deal with the devil, offering Pastor Miller to be possessed in exchange for power and wealth. He offers to share it with her, but she rejects his offer and a fight ensues with Sarah's hand being cut off in the struggle. She escapes to the chapel only to be captured by Solomon and the townspeople. At her and Hannah's execution, Sarah convinces the town to spare Hannah's life by proclaiming she is the witch and swears vengeance to Solomon before she is hanged. Later, Lizzie, Issac, Hannah, and Abigail grieve Sarah and properly bury her body.

1994: Part 2
In 1994, Deena realizes that the Goode family is responsible for the Shadyside curse, as the firstborn of each generation repeats the ritual begun by their ancestor Solomon. Because of this, Sunnyvale has always prospered while Shadyside has become worse. Deena and Josh are found by Sheriff Nick Goode, but the two escape in Nick's car and arrive at Ziggy's house. The trio deduces they must kill Nick to end the Shadyside curse. After they recruit the help of Martin, the mall janitor, the group concocts a plan to lure Nick to the mall and set traps to have the Shadyside murderers kill him.

The group manages to trap the killers and Ziggy pours a bucket of Deena's blood over Nick, causing the killers to attack him. As Nick escapes into the tunnels, Deena and a possessed Sam follow him while the others fight off the killers. Sam attacks Deena, but she breaks Sam out of her possession temporarily before incapacitating her. Nick nearly kills Deena but she exposes him to the pile of beating organs in the tunnel, which gives him the visions of all of the killers' victims, distracting him long enough for Deena to kill him. With the sheriff's death the curse is lifted, releasing Sam and evaporating the killers.

Some time later, the Goode family are exposed for their actions while life improves for the residents of Shadyside. Josh meets his online friend in person; Ziggy reunites with Mrs. Lane; Simon, Heather and Kate are commemorated by the school, and Deena and Sam have a picnic date at Sarah Fier's grave, naming her the first Shadysider.

### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Gender based violence**: The story involves Sarah and Hannah being falsely accused of witchcraft and persecuted largely based on their gender and societal norms regarding female behavior at the time.
2. **Female sexuality**: Sarah and Hannah’s romantic relationship, which is central to the plot, represents a theme of female sexuality. Their relationship is viewed as taboo and is used against them to justify the witchcraft accusations.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
- **Adolescent girl**: Sarah Fier is portrayed as a young woman dealing with the societal structures and personal tribulations of adolescence within her community in 1666.

### Monstrous Feminine
- **Monstruous feminine**: Sarah Fier is labeled as a witch and blamed for the town's misfortunes. This fits into Barbara Creed’s model, where she is seen as a possessed body or witch.

### Protagonist's Fate
- **Dies**: Sarah Fier is ultimately executed by hanging after proclaiming herself as the witch to save Hannah.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
- **Empowerment**: While Sarah is victimized in 1666, the overarching plot in 1994 reveals her as a figure who sacrifices herself to reveal the true evil, thus taking a form of control over her narrative. The protagonist Deena in 1994 also gains agency by uncovering the truth and breaking the curse, thus framing the story as one of empowerment.",2,2,1,2,1,2

In her gothic Victorian apartment she makes spells and potions, and then picks up men and seduces them. However her spells work too well, and she ends up with a string of hapless victims. When she finally meets the man of her dreams, her desperation to be loved will drive her to the brink of insanity and murder.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Witch,"Elaine, a beautiful young witch, is driving to Arcata, California, a town that tolerates witchcraft, to start a new life after the death of her husband Jerry. It is heavily implied that Elaine may have murdered him. Once there, she rents an apartment in a Victorian home owned by Elaine's mentor Barbara and kept up by its interior decorator, Trish Manning. In an effort to befriend Elaine, Trish takes her to a teahouse, where she is met by her husband Richard, who is instantly besotted with Elaine after meeting her gaze. Hoping to find a new lover, Elaine performs a ritual to find one and soon meets Wayne, a literature professor at the local college.

The two travel to Wayne's cabin, where she gets him to drink a concoction containing hallucinogens. Once the two have sex, Wayne becomes emotional and clingy, which Elaine finds off-putting. He dies the next day and Elaine buries his body along with a witch bottle containing her urine and used tampon. She decides that the next man she will try to seduce will be Richard since he is married and cannot obsess over her. While Trish is away, Elaine invites him over to her apartment, where she also serves him a concoction before seducing him with a dance. The night ends with them having sex. Afterwards, Richard becomes obsessed with Elaine, causing her to abandon their affair.

Unbeknownst to Elaine, one of Wayne's colleagues has reported him missing, leading police officer Griff to investigate and discover Wayne's body and Elaine's witch bottle. He traces it to Elaine, but falls in love with her and initially refuses to believe that she would be capable of murder, much to the ire of his partner Steve. Elaine shares his love and believes him to be the man of her dreams, even going so far as to hold a mock wedding with her coven at a Renaissance faire.

Griff's superior educates him on the tenuous peace between the town and the witches, then tells him to abandon the pursuit of Elaine as a suspect. When his partner Steve pushes him, he reveals that Wayne died of a heart attack and that the devil's weed found in his system grew around his cabin. For the first time, it is revealed that Jerry died from a drug overdose shortly before remarrying, even though he did not take drugs.

Meanwhile, a morose Richard kills himself in his bathtub and is discovered by Trish. Despondent, she invites Elaine to the teahouse and tries on a ring that Griff gave Elaine during their mock wedding, only to forget to return the ring to Elaine. Trish decides to leave the ring inside Elaine's apartment, where she proceeds to put on Elaine's makeup and underwear, imitating Elaine. Trish eventually discovers a shrine to Elaine's dead lovers, and that Richard was one of them. Trish is caught by Elaine, and Trish viciously attacks Elaine before leaving the apartment with evidence tying Elaine to Richard, swearing Elaine will burn for what she did.

Elaine then goes to the cabaret to meet Griff, who confronts her over the deaths of Wayne and Richard. He tells her that she is tied to both of them by DNA evidence left in Wayne's witch bottle and that items Trish gave him implicate her in Richard's suicide. Despite his earlier love, Griff is unwilling to let Elaine go unpunished. Their conversation is overheard by the cabaret patrons who are prejudiced towards witches and attempt to sexually assault Elaine. Griff helps her escape and the two return to her apartment.

Once safe inside, Elaine concocts a drink for him like she did for the others, but he drops it on the floor instead of drinking it. Realizing that he was correct when telling her that no man can ever love her enough, she shrinks back in disbelief, grabs her athame and murders him by stabbing him in the heart, mirroring a painting on her wall that shows a naked woman cutting a man's heart out with a dagger. In delirium, she smiles and imagines them at their wedding and that Griff actually proposed.","The Love Witch uses the figure of the witch as a metaphor for women in general, as both an embodiment of men's fears of women, and of women's own innate powers of intuition and as mothers and sorceresses.[12] The lead character of the film is a young woman who uses magic to make men love her. Her character is an examination of the femme fatale archetype.[13] The film embraces the camp of 1960s horror,[14] examining issues of love, desire, and narcissism through a feminist perspective.[15] Anna Biller is a feminist filmmaker whose take on cinema is influenced by feminist film theory.","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

Instead, she embodies a powerful, single woman who uses witchcraft and sexuality to her advantage, fitting more closely with the archetype of a femme fatale or enchantress.

### Monstrous Feminine:
1) **Monstrous feminine (witch, monstrous mother):** Elaine can be seen as a witch, using her magical abilities and her sorceress qualities to manipulate and control men, and she embodies men's fears of women with power.

### Protagonist's Fate:
1) **Dies:** Elaine survives physically, but she kills Griff in a delusional state, imagining their wedding. Her mental state suggests a loss of touch with reality, which complicates the notion of survival.

### Focus of the Story:
2) **Empowerment:** While Elaine does exhibit behaviors and actions that put her in power over others, the storyline delves into her taking control of her life and her destiny, even though this journey is imbued with narcissism and manipulation. The film portrays her as a deeply flawed but empowered figure, rather than a perpetual victim.

Given the complexity of Elaine's character, ""The Love Witch"" blends empowerment and victimization. Elaine's witchcraft provides her with significant power and autonomy, though her psychological and emotional vulnerabilities lead to destructive outcomes.",3,3,1,2,2,1
"As Above, So Below",2014,John Erick Dowdle,M,Perdita Weeks,F,"When a team of explorers ventures into the catacombs that lie beneath the streets of Paris, they uncover the dark secret that lies within this city of the dead.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Above,_So_Below_(film)","Scarlett Marlowe is a young scholar, continuing her dead father's search for the philosopher's stone, a legendary alchemical substance discovered by the alchemist Nicolas Flamel. The reputed stone can allegedly turn base metals into gold or silver and grant eternal life. Scarlett discovers the ""Rose Key"" artifact in a cave slated for demolition, but after she sees a vision of a hanged man, the demolition begins, and she narrowly escapes.

Scarlett travels to Paris. She enlists her former lover, George, and her cameraman, Benji. Using codes from the key, they solve a riddle on Flamel's headstone and get coordinates pointing to the Catacombs of Paris. Scarlett tries to reach the location on an official tour, but it is off-limits. A stranger tells them that a cataphile named Papillon will help them if they find him at a nearby club. The three visit the club and recruit Papillon, his girlfriend Souxie, and their friend Zed.

Papillon takes the group to an off-limits entrance. George initially refuses to enter, but when a policeman confronts them, the group escapes into the catacombs. They encounter singing female cultists, including a woman they saw at the club. The group finds a blocked tunnel. Scarlett removes a brick to unseal the tunnel, but Papillon explains that people who go through that tunnel disappear. His friend La Taupe (""The Mole"") is among the missing. The group takes an alternate route through a narrow tunnel, but it collapses behind them, nearly killing Benji. Inexplicably, they find themselves in front of the same blocked tunnel and are left with no choice but to break through.

Inside, the group finds La Taupe, a condemned ghost trapped within the purgatorial catacombs. He tells them going further down is the only way out. They eventually find a tomb with a preserved Templar Knight, a mound of treasure, and the Flamel Stone. Scarlett takes the stone, but when Papillon's group tries to take the treasure, they trigger a trap that causes the ceiling to collapse. La Taupe seems lost under the rubble.

Scarlett can supernaturally heal a wound on Souxie's arm using the Flamel Stone. They find a drawing of a door on the ceiling along with a Gnostic Star of David, symbolizing ""As above, so below"", which reveals a hidden opening in the floor. Going through, they find a tunnel marked with the phrase ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"" in Greek, identical to the script on the entrance to Hell in Dante's Inferno.

On the other side of the tunnel, the group finds an upside-down reflection of the treasure room, where La Taupe is waiting. He kills Souxie and disappears. As they descend deeper, an entity resembling a woman holding a child pushes Benji to his death. Papillon is then sucked into a burning car by an apparition resembling the stranger who had told Scarlett to find Papillon. The car implodes and buries Papillon on the floor. Scarlett, George, and Zed proceed deeper into the tunnels and see apparitions of terrifying spirits and demons. Statues in the wall come to life, and one rips open George's throat. Scarlett tries to heal the wound with the Flamel Stone but cannot. She realizes she has stolen a false stone and must return it to its original place to find the natural stone and heal George.

Scarlett races back, finding the tunnels are now flooded with blood and covered in biting faces. When she returns the stone, she sees a mirror and realizes the true power of the Flamel Stone is within her. As she returns to George and Zed, she sees the same hanged man that she saw in Iran and recognizes him as her father. She apologizes for ignoring his phone call shortly before he committed suicide, and her father vanishes. Scarlett then returns to George, instantly healing him with a kiss.

Chased by demons, the three survivors are cornered before a dark hole. Scarlett explains that they must jump in and confess their past sins to escape alive. George admits that he failed to save his brother from drowning, and Zed confesses that he has an illegitimate child he has refused to claim. They jump into the hole and miraculously survive. They find a manhole at the bottom, which opens up to the streets of Paris. Scarlett and George hold each other while Zed walks away, finally safe.

In an ending log, Scarlett says she never ventured to seek or obtain any material treasure, only the truth.

The Nun,2018,Corin Hardy,M,Taissa Farmiga,F,"When a young nun at a cloistered abbey in Romania takes her own life, a priest with a haunted past and a novitiate on the threshold of her final vows are sent by the Vatican to investigate. Together they uncover the order’s unholy secret. Risking not only their lives but their faith and their very souls, they confront a malevolent force in the form of the same demonic nun that first terrorized audiences in “The Conjuring 2” as the abbey becomes a horrific battleground between the living and the damned.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nun_(2018_film),"In 1952 Romania, two nuns living at the Saint Cartha's monastery are attacked by an unseen evil force. The surviving nun, Sister Victoria, flees from the attacker, a demon appearing as a nun, and hangs herself. Her body is discovered by Frenchie, a villager who transports supplies to the nuns.

The Vatican sends Father Burke with Sister Irene, a nun in her novitiate, to Romania to investigate. The pair meets Frenchie, discover Victoria's body, and take a key from her corpse. Inside the abbey, they meet the Abbess, who informs them that the nuns observe silence during the night so they need to return the next day. That night, Burke is rescued by Irene after being buried alive in the graveyard by the demonic entity.

The next day, Irene and Burke return to the abbey, but only Irene can enter as it is cloistered. She meets the other nuns and learns that they are praying constantly, swapping in shifts, to keep the entity at bay. The abbey was built in the Dark Ages as a castle for the Duke of St. Carta, a powerful aristocrat obsessed with the occult. The duke summoned the demon through a rift in the catacombs but was killed by Christian knights, who sealed the rift with a vial filled with the Blood of Christ. However, the bombings during World War II reopened the rift, unleashing the entity. Burke, through a book which he saw and took after being buried alive, identifies the demon as Valak and discovers the Abbess has been dead all along.

Irene is attacked by Valak and joins the nuns in prayer to ward it off. When she reunites with Burke and Frenchie, she discovers that none of the nuns she had seen and talked to were real and she had been praying alone. Sister Victoria had in fact been the last nun in that abbey and had sacrificed herself to stop Valak from possessing her.

Theorizing that Valak can only be stopped if they seal the rift again with the blood of Christ from the reliquary the same way the knights did, the trio retrieves the vial with Victoria's key. Irene asks Burke to elevate her status to a professed nun, which he does. In the tunnel, she is possessed by Valak but Frenchie smears the blood of Christ on her face, casting out the demon. Valak starts to drown her in a flooded chamber. Irene, who had kept some of Christ's blood from the vial in her mouth, spits it into the demon's face, banishing it as the rift is sealed. Frenchie resuscitates Irene and reveals his real name is Maurice. Unbeknownst to the others, during the attack, Maurice was possessed by Valak.

Twenty years later at a university seminar in Wakefield, Massachusetts, Carolyn Perron watches as Ed and Lorraine Warren present footage of their attempt to exorcise a possessed older Maurice. Maurice grabs Lorraine, showing her a vision of Ed dying, which initiates the Warrens' investigation of the Perron farmhouse haunting.

She meets with Cardinal Lawrence, Father Gabriel, Abess Sister Silva, nun Anjelica, and her roommate and fellow novitiate Luz. Luz invites Margaret to a disco, where they meet two men. Luz dances with one of the men while Margaret dances with the other man named Paolo before blacking out. She awakens the next day with no memory of what happened.

Margaret bonds with the mistreated orphan Carlita, who is plagued by bad visions. Father Brennan warns her about Carlita, saying ""evil things"" will happen around her. Margaret spots Carlita showing Anjelica a drawing of a pregnant woman being restrained; moments later, Anjelica self-immolates and hangs herself.

Brennan explains that radicals within the church, desperate to regain power against the rise of secularism, seek to bring about the Antichrist to create fear and drive people back to the church, with Carlita intended to be his mother. During a field trip, a riot breaks out and Margaret experiences demonic hallucinations. Sister Silva postpones Margaret's vows and orders her to distance herself from Carlita. She spots Paolo; horrified, he tells her to ""look for the mark"" before getting cut in half by an oncoming truck.

Margaret sneaks into Sister Silva's office. She uncovers a hidden, underground chamber and a series of subject files, all labeled ""Scianna"". They contain photos of mostly dysmorphic babies with a birthmark in the shape of three sixes, with Carlita as seemingly the only survivor. Margaret is intercepted and spots the mark on Carlita's palate before being imprisoned.

Father Gabriel frees Margaret; as they examine the files with Brennan, they discover that another baby had survived. Margaret locates the mark on her own scalp and suddenly remembers that she was forcefully impregnated in a satanic ritual the night she blacked out at the disco.

Saint Maud,2019,Rose Glass,F,Morfydd Clark,F,"Having recently found God, self-effacing young nurse Maud arrives at a plush home to care for Amanda, a hedonistic dancer left frail from a chronic illness. When a chance encounter with a former colleague throws up hints of a dark past, it becomes clear there is more to sweet Maud than meets the eye.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Maud,"A nurse named Katie fails to save the life of a patient in her care, despite attempting CPR.

Some time later, Katie, now referring to herself as Maud, has become a devout Roman Catholic and is working as a private palliative care nurse in an English seaside town. She is assigned to care for Amanda, a hedonistic former dancer and choreographer from the United States who is terminally ill with stage four lymphoma. Amanda is embittered by her fate and confesses to Maud that she fears the oblivion of death. Maud comes to believe that God has tasked her with saving the atheist Amanda's soul. Maud reveals to Amanda that she sometimes feels God's presence, and she and Amanda appear to be overcome with ecstasy as they pray together.

Maud becomes suspicious of Amanda's lesbian companion Carol, who visits regularly and with whom Amanda has sex. She implores Carol to stop visiting because she believes Amanda's soul is in jeopardy due to distractions of the flesh. Carol is incensed by this, accusing Maud of homophobia, but Maud rebukes this stating that she would not care whether Carol were a man or a woman. Carol attends Amanda's birthday party anyway, and in front of Maud, Amanda informs the partygoers that Maud tried to drive Carol away. The party guests laugh at Maud, calling her ""Saint Maude"", and wrap a cover on her head. Amanda mocks Maud for trying to save her soul and suggests that she is a homophobic prude, jealous of her relationship with Carol. Maud strikes Amanda and is dismissed from her job.

Believing that God has rejected her, Maud visits a pub to find companionship but is rejected by most of the people she meets. She goes home with a man and during sex suffers flashbacks of the death of her patient and her attempts at CPR, which causes her to stop. The man feigns sympathy but proceeds to rape Maud,[6] who appears to dissociate. As she is leaving, he taunts her by revealing that he remembers her hooking up with a friend of his during her hedonistic past.

While out walking, she encounters Amanda's new nurse and storms off when she realizes that her replacement enjoys a good relationship with Amanda. In her decrepit apartment, Maud begs for a sign from God who appears to tell her to be ready for an act that will demonstrate her faith. Repentant of her actions, Maud assembles a spugna for her right foot to practice the mortification of the flesh.

That night, Maud, dressed in a makeshift robe and wearing rosary beads, enters Amanda's house after the care nurse leaves. She finds Amanda in bed, weakened. Amanda asks forgiveness for mocking her faith, and Maud joyously reminds her of the time they experienced God's presence. Amanda reveals that she feigned the experience and that she believes God is not real. Maud recoils in horror as a now-demonic Amanda hurls her across the room and mocks her for needing to prove her faith. In a delirious frenzy, Maud stabs Amanda to death with a pair of scissors.

In the morning, Maud wanders onto a beach and douses herself with acetone before horrified onlookers. She utters her last words in Welsh—""Glory to God""—as she self-immolates. In her last moments, angel wings appear upon her and the onlookers kneel in awe as Maud looks up to the sky glowing with grace. The scene then smash-cuts for a split second to the reality of Maud being burned alive and screaming in agony.",,"**Movie Title: Saint Maud**

**Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. **Motherhood:** While not directly related to traditional motherhood, the themes of caregiving, palliative care, and Maud's misguided sense of duty to ""save"" Amanda's soul through nurturing and intervention can be analogized to maternal instincts and protective behavior.
2. **Gender-based violence:** The film portrays a scene where Maud is raped, which speaks directly to issues of sexual assault and the vulnerabilities that women face.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
5. **Other:** Maud is a private palliative care nurse, which involves caretaking but not in the traditional roles like a housewife, mother or professional related specifically to beauty. Her profession as a nurse could also be seen as related to caretaking, but her hyper-religious zealotry and subsequent actions take her role beyond this traditional capacity.

**Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster in the Story?**
1. **Monstrous feminine:** Maud exhibits traits that fit into several of Barbara Creed's identified faces of the monstrous-feminine. The culminating act of stabbing Amanda while envisioning her as a demon and her self-immolation can be interpreted as manifestations of the ""possessed body"" and the ""monstrous mother/castrator,"" wherein she takes on a role of moral authority and punishes those she sees as impure.

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?**
1. **Dies:** Maud dies by self-immolation on a public beach.

**Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?**
1. **Victimization:** The story primarily revolves around Maud's psychological decline and her victimization through her own delusions and the societal rejection she faces. Although she takes drastic actions in the name of her perceived faith and purpose, she does not gain agency or autonomy in a manner that reflects true empowerment. Her actions lead to her demise, showcasing her victimization to her own mental state and societal circumstances.

In summary, ""Saint Maud"" intertwines aspects of motherhood through themes of caregiving and protection, delves deep into gender-based violence with issues like sexual assault, portrays its protagonist in a non-traditional caretaking role corrupted by religious fervor, ultimately victimizes its lead, and ends in her death while embedding elements of the ""monstrous feminine"" within its narrative.",5,4,1,1,1,1
Vivarium,2019,Lorcan Finnegan,M,Imogen Poots,F,"A young woman and her fiancé are in search of the perfect starter home. After following a mysterious real estate agent to a new housing development, the couple finds themselves trapped in a maze of identical houses and forced to raise an otherworldly child.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivarium_(film),"The opening scene depicts the brood parasitism of a cuckoo before introducing primary school teacher Gemma and her landscaper boyfriend Tom. He buries a dead altricial chick ejected from its nest. They drive to meet with real estate agent Martin and follow him to a suburban development of identical houses called Yonder. Martin shows them around house number 9. He asks if they have children, and when Gemma replies, ""No, not yet"", he mimics her perfectly. After looking around the garden they find Martin has vanished. Attempting to leave, they repeatedly find themselves back at number 9. They drive around the endless, identical streets until they run out of fuel.

They sleep in the house. The next morning, they try to escape on foot, but consistently return to number 9. They find a box of tasteless vacuum-packed food in front of the house. Tom sets fire to the house and they sleep on the pavement. When they awake another box has been left, containing an infant and the message, ""Raise the child and be released."" When the smoke clears, the house is undamaged.

98 days later, the infant is the size of a ten year-old boy. It mimics Tom and Gemma and shrieks when it wants food. When it calls Gemma ""Mother"", she insists that she is not its mother, while Tom refers to The Boy as ""it"". Gemma and Tom wait in the garden with a pickaxe to attack whoever delivers the food, but they never see anyone. Tom begins digging a hole in the garden and becomes withdrawn. In the living room, The Boy watches fractal-like patterns on the television.

Tom locks The Boy in their car, thinking if someone comes for it they could force them to free them. However, Gemma takes pity and releases The Boy. Tom continues digging and begins sleeping in the hole. One day The Boy goes missing and returns with a book of symbols and diagrams of humanoids with throat sacs. When Gemma asks it to mimic the person who gave it the book, it makes rasping sounds and inflates its own throat sacs.

The Boy matures to resemble a young adult and Tom becomes ill. The Boy leaves each day and Gemma tries to follow it but always finds herself back at number 9. Tom continues to dig and finds a corpse in a vacuum bag. The Boy locks Gemma and Tom out of the house and they sleep in the car. Gemma pleads with The Boy for medicine for Tom but it replies, ""Maybe it's time he was released."" Tom dies and The Boy zips him into a vacuum bag and throws it into the hole.

Gemma wounds The Boy with the pickaxe. The Boy hisses and crawls into a labyrinth under the sidewalk. Gemma follows and crashes through a door into multiple rooms in other houses with more Boys and several strangers, one of whom has died by suicide.

She lands back in number 9, weak and moaning. The Boy is cleaning the house. He carries her to a vacuum bag explaining that mothers die after raising their sons. She dies as he zips her in. The Boy buries her with Tom and drives back to the real estate office, where an aged Martin lies dying. Martin gives The Boy his name tag and dies. The Boy zips Martin into a vacuum bag and puts it into a garbage chute disguised as a file drawer. When a couple walks in the door, The Boy greets them just as Martin did.",,"For the movie ""Vivarium,"" I will analyze the requested points based on the given plot and the available information:

### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: The theme of motherhood is explicitly portrayed as Gemma is forced to raise ""The Boy"" despite not being its biological mother. The process of raising this child serves as a core aspect of the story, emphasizing the involuntary and burdensome aspects of motherhood. Additionally, the plot highlights the concept of forced motherhood and its psychological toll.
   
2. **Other**: The film can also be interpreted through the lens of existential horror or domestic entrapment, where womanhood is related to being trapped in domestic and societal roles that one cannot escape. This theme doesn’t fit neatly into the listed categories but instead speaks to the broader, often nightmarish, pressure of societal expectations on women.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
1. **Professional Related to Caretaking**: Gemma is a primary school teacher, which traditionally is a caretaking position focused on the development and well-being of children.
2. **Other**: Despite having a professional role, in the context of the plot, her primary role transitions to an involuntary caretaker or surrogate mother when she is forced to raise The Boy. This reflects a shift from her actual profession to a role imposed on her by the circumstances.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Although Gemma herself is not portrayed as overtly monstrous, the concept of ""mother"" in the context of this story becomes nightmarish. The Boy’s demands and the oppressive scenario could symbolize the idea of the monstrous child, which indirectly makes Gemma a victim of the ""monstrous womb"" – a nightmarish scenario of forced motherhood that ultimately leads to her demise.

### Does the Protagonist Die or Survive?
1. **Dies**: Gemma dies at the end of the movie, zipped into a vacuum bag by The Boy.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment?
1. **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on the victimization of Gemma. Throughout the movie, she and Tom are subjected to physical and psychological threats, and Gemma is not able to gain agency or autonomy. The narrative centers on her immediate survival and the horror of her situation, emphasizing her lack of control and ultimate demise without achieving empowerment.

In summary, ""Vivarium"" deals with themes of forced motherhood and societal entrapment while portraying Gemma in a caretaking role. She is portrayed as a victim rather than empowered, ultimately leading to her death, which further underlines her victimization.",1,4,2,1,1,1
The Visit,2015,M. Night Shyamalan,M,Olivia DeJonge,F,"The terrifying story of a brother and sister who are sent to their grandparents' remote Pennsylvania farm for a weeklong trip. Once the children discover that the elderly couple is involved in something deeply disturbing, they see their chances of getting back home are growing smaller every day.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Visit_(2015_American_film),"Two siblings from Philadelphia, Becca and Tyler, prepare for a five-day visit with their grandparents while their divorced mother Loretta goes on a cruise with her boyfriend. Loretta reveals that she has not spoken to her parents in 15 years after marrying her high-school teacher, of whom her parents disapproved. Having never met their grandparents, the teens plan to record a documentary film about their visit using a camcorder.

Becca and Tyler meet their grandparents, referred to as ""Nana"" and ""Pop Pop,"" at a train station. When they arrive at their isolated farmhouse, Becca and Tyler are instructed to never go into the basement because it contains mold, and that bedtime is at 9:30 every evening, after which they should not leave their room. Although at first, the grandparents seem pleasant, their behavior gradually becomes peculiar. The first night, an hour past curfew, Becca ventures downstairs for something to eat and sees Nana projectile vomiting. During the day, Nana chases the teens while they play hide-and-seek. Later, Tyler finds a pile of soiled diapers in the shed. In town, Pop Pop attacks a man he thinks is following them. When challenged, both grandparents are dismissive of each other's behavior. As the erratic behavior intensifies, Becca and Tyler's documentary-style film evolves into one of mystery-solving and evidence collection.

A woman Nana and Pop Pop helped in counseling brings a blueberry cobbler to thank them, but following a confrontation is not seen leaving. Concerned about the series of strange events, Tyler decides to secretly film the living room during the night, but Nana discovers the camera and tries unsuccessfully to break into the children's locked bedroom with a knife.

Upon watching the footage of Nana with the knife, Becca and Tyler video call Loretta and beg her to collect them. They use the laptop camera to show Loretta the odd behavior of her parents, who are outside the house. Upon seeing them, Loretta, distressed, identifies that the couple her children have been staying with are not her parents. Realizing they have been staying with strangers, the teenagers try to escape the house and discover the visitor who went missing hanging from a tree. The ""grandparents"" find the children and force them to play Yahtzee. Later, Becca sneaks into the basement and finds the decomposed corpses of their real grandparents, along with uniforms from the psychiatric hospital at which they worked, revealing that their ""grandparents"" are actually escaped patients. Pop Pop grabs Becca and imprisons her in his bedroom with Nana, who tries to attack her in a psychotic fit. He then tortures Tyler by smearing his face with his dirty diaper. Following a struggle, Becca fatally stabs Nana with a glass shard from a broken mirror, then runs to the kitchen and attacks Pop Pop. As Pop Pop gains the upper hand, Tyler knocks him to the floor and kills him by repeatedly bashing his head with the refrigerator door. The teens escape outside, where they are met by their mother and police officers.

In the aftermath, Becca asks Loretta about what happened the day she left home fifteen years earlier. Loretta reflects that she had a major argument with her parents, during which she hit her mother and was then struck by her father. Loretta then left home and ignored their attempts to contact her. Loretta concludes that reconciliation was always possible had she wanted it. She tells Becca not to hold on to anger over her father's abandonment, and Becca decides to include footage of her father in their documentary after earlier saying she would not do so.

Back home, Tyler records and does a freestyle rap about his and Becca's misadventure with the fake grandparents, while Becca looks on approvingly.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Gender-Based Violence**: The story reveals moments of physical assault, particularly when Nana, one of the impostors, attempts to attack Becca during a psychotic fit and when Pop Pop tortures Tyler by smearing his face with a dirty diaper. These scenes showcase forms of abuse and violence.
2. **Other - Familial Estrangement and Reconciliation**: Much of the emotional core of the story revolves around Loretta's estrangement from her parents and the potential for reconciliation had she been willing to forgive. This touches on broader themes of familial relationships and the possibilities of mending broken bonds.

### Role of Main Protagonist
1. **Professional related to caretaking (such as nun, nurse, teacher)**: While Becca and Tyler are not in traditional caretaking roles, their visit to their ""grandparents"" involves them observing and recording the behavior of their grandparents, taking on a kind of investigative or observatory caretaking role. However, it doesn't strictly fit into traditional roles. They are more accurately **other** as young individuals thrust into an extraordinary situation where they assume adult responsibilities.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Monstrous feminine (witch, possessed body)**: Nana exhibits characteristics that can be classified under the ""possessed body"" or ""witch"" archetypes, given her psychotic behavior and attempts to harm Becca with a knife. This portrayal aligns with Creed's concept of the Monstrous-Feminine.

### Protagonist's Fate
1. **Survives**: Both Becca and Tyler survive the ordeal. They manage to overcome the impostors and reunite with their mother.

### Focus on Victimization or Empowerment
1. **Empowerment**: While the teenagers do face a constant threat, the story arcs towards their empowerment. Becca and Tyler use their resourcefulness to uncover the truth and ultimately defend themselves against their attackers, gaining agency and autonomy in the process.",2,5,2,2,2,1
Lamb,2021,Valdimar Jóhannsson,M,Noomi Rapace,F,"A couple discover a mysterious half-lamb/half-human newborn on their farm in Iceland. The unexpected prospect of family life brings them much joy, before ultimately destroying them.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_(2021_film),"In Iceland, a herd of horses is spooked by an unknown, loudly-breathing entity that makes its way to a barn. Later, farmer María and her husband Ingvar are shocked when one of their pregnant sheep gives birth to a human/sheep hybrid with a mostly human body and a lamb's head and right arm.

María and Ingvar take the hybrid infant in as their own and grow to love her as their own child, naming her Ada after María's deceased daughter. The ewe that is Ada's biological mother misses her child and becomes a nuisance, attempting to contact Ada constantly and loitering outside the couple's home. Shortly after an incident where Ada goes missing and is later found next to the ewe, María shoots the ewe and buries her body in a shallow, unmarked grave. Unbeknownst to her, Ingvar's roving brother Pétur, who arrives at the farmhouse shortly before the killing, witnesses the incident before sleeping in the barn.

Pétur, who makes sexual advances towards María, is very disturbed by Ada and maintains the belief that ""it's an animal, not a child"". Ingvar claims the whole situation has given them happiness. Increasingly angered and disturbed by María and Ingvar's attachment to Ada, Pétur takes her on an early morning walk while everyone is asleep with the intention of shooting her. After having a tearful change of heart, however, he is later seen soundly sleeping with Ada and soon becomes an uncle to her.

One evening, while María, Pétur, and Ingvar are having a drunken party, Ada witnesses the unknown entity from before near the barn. The entity then proceeds to kill the family's dog before taking the family's gun. After the party, a drunk Ingvar goes to bed. Pétur makes sexual advances towards María once again. When she rejects his advances, Pétur reveals that he witnessed María killing Ada's sheep mother, trying to blackmail María into having sex with him by threatening to reveal this to Ada. María pretends to be seduced by Pétur in order to lock him in a storage room.

The next morning, María unlocks the storage room and drives him to the bus stop, sending him away, insisting she is committed to a new start with her family. After waking up to find María and Pétur missing, Ingvar takes Ada to fix the broken tractor left halfway to the lake, the attempt proven unsuccessful. On their way back home, the entity, revealed to be a ram/man hybrid and Ada's biological father, emerges and shoots Ingvar in the neck, before taking a tearful Ada with him and walking away into the wilderness.

María returns home and finds that Ingvar and Ada are missing. She searches for the two and discovers Ingvar before he dies, and despairs at the loss of her husband and new child. María searches the wilderness in vain, before closing her tear-filled eyes.",,"Based on the provided plot and themes for the movie ""Lamb,"" here's the analysis:

### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: The theme of motherhood is prominent in this film. María and Ingvar take a sheep-human hybrid as their own and name her Ada after their deceased daughter. María’s actions, such as shooting the ewe that gave birth to Ada to protect her, demonstrate a fierce maternal instinct and the desire to maintain her new family.
2. **Gender Based Violence**: There are instances of gender-based violence, particularly in the form of sexual advances and blackmail by Pétur towards María. His behavior towards her accentuates themes of power dynamics and sexual coercion.

### Role of the Main Protagonist
1. **Mother or Housewife**: María takes on the role of a mother, nurturing Ada and protecting her at all costs. This fits within the traditional female role of a mother.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Other**: María is not portrayed as a monstrous feminine figure in the narrative. She is driven by maternal instincts and protectiveness, rather than embodying any traditional horror-themed monstrous forms like the archaic mother, monstrous womb, or witch.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist
1. **Survives**: María survives at the end of the film, although she suffers immense loss with the death of her husband and the disappearance of Ada.

### Story Focus: Female Victimization or Empowerment
1. **Victimization**: The story leans more towards female victimization. María experiences the loss of both her husband and Ada, and she is subjected to sexual advances and blackmail. While she exhibits some agency in sending Pétur away and caring for Ada, the persistent tragedies and powerlessness she faces suggest a focus on her victimization over empowerment.

In conclusion, ""Lamb"" concentrates on the complexities of motherhood and faces themes of gender-based violence, portraying María as a mother who navigates significant emotional and psychological challenges, ultimately leading to a narrative more about victimization than empowerment.",1,1,2,1,2,1
Halloween Ends,2022,David Gordon Green,M,Jamie Lee Curtis,F,"Four years after the events of Halloween in 2018, Laurie has decided to liberate herself from fear and rage and embrace life. But when a young man is accused of killing a boy he was babysitting, it ignites a cascade of violence and terror that will force Laurie to finally confront the evil she can’t control, once and for all.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_Ends,"On Halloween night in 2019, 21-year-old Corey Cunningham babysits a young boy named Jeremy Allen, who pulls a prank on him by locking him inside the attic. Just as Jeremy's parents come home, Corey kicks the door open and accidentally knocks Jeremy over a staircase railing to his death. Corey is arrested for aggravated manslaughter but is cleared by the judge. Nonetheless the citizens of Haddonfield make Corey an outcast.

Three years later, the town of Haddonfield, Illinois, is still reeling from the aftermath of Michael Myers's latest killing spree in 2018,[a] while Michael has vanished. Laurie Strode is writing a memoir and living with her granddaughter Allyson. Meanwhile, Corey is working at his stepfather's salvage yard. On his way home one day, he is accosted by high school bullies and injures himself in the process. An observing Laurie brings him to the doctor's office where Allyson works. Allyson and Corey develop a relationship and later attend a Halloween party, where Corey is confronted by Mrs. Allen. Corey leaves the party and runs into the bullies who throw him off a bridge. Unconscious, he is dragged into the sewers and later choked by Michael who eventually lets him go. As he crawls out, Corey is threatened by a homeless man. In a struggle, Corey stabs the man to death and flees.

At a dinner date, Allyson’s ex-boyfriend harasses her, leading to Corey later luring him into the sewer to be killed by Michael. Allyson is passed over for a promotion at work, in favor of a nurse who is having an affair with the doctor. Later that night, Corey kills the doctor at his home while Michael kills the nurse. An unknowing Allyson plans to leave Haddonfield with an insistent Corey because of the past trauma, while Laurie realizes Corey is infected by Michael's evil; their different mindsets causes their relationship to fracture. Laurie finds Corey sleeping in the spot where Jeremy died, and offers to help him on the condition that he distance himself from Allyson. Corey retorts by blaming her for the events that have occurred in Haddonfield and says if he cannot have Allyson, no one will.

Corey returns to the sewers where he successfully fights Michael for his mask and embarks on a rampage, murdering the bullies after luring them to the salvage yard, one of whom accidentally kills Corey's stepfather. He goes on to kill his mother, a DJ at a local radio station, who had taunted him earlier, and presumably the radio station's assistant. At the Strode house, Laurie fakes a suicide attempt to lure Corey to her, whom she shoots down the stairs. Corey then stabs himself in the neck to frame Laurie for his death in front of the arriving Allyson, who leaves in distress. Michael suddenly arrives, retrieves his mask, and kills Corey. A fight ensues in Laurie's kitchen, and Laurie manages to pin Michael to the kitchen table and slit his throat. After a struggle, Allyson, convinced of the truth behind Corey's death after receiving a call from Deputy Frank Hawkins, returns to help subdue and finally kill Michael by slicing his wrist.

Laurie and Allyson take Michael's body to the salvage yard by police escort, attracting the residents of Haddonfield, who follow them in a procession, and dispose of it in an industrial shredder. In the ensuing days, Allyson and Laurie reconcile, and Allyson leaves Haddonfield while Laurie finishes her memoir and rediscovers her romance with Hawkins.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Gender Based Violence**: The continuous terror and physical threats faced by Laurie from Michael Myers encapsulate gender-based violence. This is evident in the history of the franchise and in how both Michael Myers and Corey Cunningham perpetuate violence and terror in Haddonfield.
   
2. **Other**: The themes of trauma and survival play prominent roles in the movie. Both Laurie and Allyson deal with their past traumas and the long-term psychological impacts of violent events. This isn’t strictly within the realm of the provided categories but is crucial to understanding the character dynamics and development.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

1. **Other**: Laurie Strode is neither a mother or housewife, nor an adolescent girl. She does not fit into a professional role related to beauty or caretaking. She is primarily characterized as a survivor and a determined woman who takes on the role of a defender and protector, especially towards her granddaughter Allyson. Her role revolves around combating an ongoing threat and facing her past traumas head-on.

### Monstrous Feminine:

1. **Other**: Laurie Strode is portrayed as a survivor and a fighter rather than a monstrous figure. Her character does not fit into the monstrous feminine archetype, as defined by Barbara Creed. Instead, she is depicted as a protective and resilient figure, striving to overcome the monstrous masculine threat embodied by Michael Myers and the violence enacted by Corey.

### Protagonist's Fate:

1. **Survives**: Laurie survives at the end of the movie. After defeating Michael Myers with the help of her granddaughter Allyson, Laurie continues to live and reconciles with Allyson.

### Story Focus - Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:

1. **Empowerment**: The story demonstrates elements of female empowerment. Laurie Strode actively confronts her fears and ultimately defeats Michael Myers, thereby taking control of her own narrative and protecting her family. The movie showcases her not merely as a victim, but as a strong, resilient character who overcomes significant threats and trauma, and gains agency and autonomy by the end of the film. This empowerment extends to Allyson as well, who aids in finally subduing and killing Michael.",2,5,2,2,2,1
No One Will Save You,2023,Brian Duffield,M,Kaitlyn Dever,F,An exiled anxiety-ridden homebody must battle an alien who's found its way into her home.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_One_Will_Save_You,"Brynn is a seamstress who lives alone in her childhood home in a forest on the outskirts of a small town. Mourning the loss of both her best friend, Maude, and her mother, Sarah, Brynn copes by constructing a model town in her living room. She leads a solitary existence and is shunned by the local townspeople. One night, she awakens to discover that a humanoid alien has broken into her home. The alien uses telekinesis to subdue her, but she accidentally kills it in self-defense with the broken fragment of a model bell tower.

Finding that her car and all of her electrical devices have been rendered useless since the alien intrusion, Brynn cycles into town, where she uncovers evidence of alien attacks on her neighbors. The town appears unaffected as she makes her way to the local police station, where she unexpectedly encounters Maude's parents, who happen to be the chief of police and his wife. Maude's embittered mother spits in Brynn's face. Brynn flees the town on a bus, but several passengers attempt to restrain her and are revealed to be controlled by alien parasites placed in their throats. She escapes and discovers that many of the townspeople now appear to be under the parasites' control.

Brynn returns home and fortifies her house. That evening, a tractor beam from a flying saucer carries the alien's corpse out of her house, and she is forced to fend off two more alien intruders; she impales the smaller one with a broken mop handle and immolates the bigger one when its legs become entangled in her car and she ignites the gas tank. After she runs back into her house, another alien restrains her and places a parasite in her mouth, seemingly being forced to do so against its will. Brynn experiences an intense hallucination in which her life is back to normal and Maude is still alive. She apologizes to Maude before breaking free of the hallucination and pulling the parasite from her mouth, finding herself lying in a field. A flying saucer arrives and transforms the parasite into a doppelgänger of Brynn, which pursues the real Brynn into the woods.

The doppelgänger catches Brynn and stabs her, but Brynn kills it with a box cutter and escapes to a deserted road. She encounters a gigantic alien before being sucked into a flying saucer, where she is psychically probed by a group of aliens, revealing the event that turned the town against her: during an argument she had with Maude when both were children, Maude knocked Brynn to the ground and Brynn struck Maude with a rock, killing her. The aliens converse with one another and appear to agree on a course of action. They return Brynn to the deserted road, unharmed and free of their influence.

Brynn rebuilds her home and discovers that the other residents remain under the control of the parasites. They now treat her kindly and since she has finally overcome her trauma, she can live a normal life. In the sky, numerous flying saucers are seen stretching off into the horizon.",,"### Movie Analysis: ""No One Will Save You""

1. **Themes Related to Womanhood:**
   - **Motherhood:** Brynn's actions throughout the movie can be partially tied to themes of motherhood, particularly in her mourning for both her best friend, Maude, and her mother, Sarah. Her solitary life and coping mechanisms reflect her unresolved grief, which is reminiscent of themes surrounding the nurturing and loss aspects found in motherhood.
   - **Other:** Another significant theme is trauma and guilt, as Brynn is haunted by the accidental killing of her friend Maude during their childhood. This theme isn't explicitly related to one of the listed categories but is significant in defining her character arc and the narrative.

2. **Role of Main Protagonist:**
   - **Other:** Brynn does not fit neatly into traditional female roles such as a mother, housewife, adolescent girl, or professional roles related to caretaking or beauty. She is a seamstress who lives an isolated life and her story revolves around coping with trauma and surviving an alien invasion, which doesn't align with the given categories.

3. **Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?**
   - **Other:** Brynn is portrayed as a victim and survivor rather than a monster. The movie focuses on her struggle against external alien threats and her internal battle with guilt, not as a representation of the monstrous feminine archetypes described by Barbara Creed.

4. **Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?**
   - **Survives:** Brynn survives the alien invasion and her own personal trauma, managing to rebuild her life and home by the movie's end.

5. **Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?**
   - **Empowerment:** While Brynn is initially a victim of both external (alien invasion) and internal (personal guilt and town's hatred) circumstances, she gains agency and control over her life. By the end of the movie, she overcomes her emotional and physical threats, takes action to defend herself, and attempts to live a semblance of a normal life despite the continuing presence of aliens. This arc aligns more closely with female empowerment.",5,5,2,2,2,1
Paranormal Activity,2007,Oren Peli,M,Katie Featherston,F,"Soon after moving into a suburban tract home, Katie and Micah become increasingly disturbed by what appears to be a supernatural presence. Hoping to capture evidence of it on film, they set up video cameras in the house but are not prepared for the terrifying events that follow.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal_Activity,"Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. Psychic Dr. Fredrichs visits the couple and suggests Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting her. She said something like this happened to her and her younger sister Kristi when they were children. He advises not to communicate with the demon without a demonologist, but Micah continues to film and seek it out.

The camera captures many strange occurrences during the night: they start off as minor noises, flickering lights, and bedroom door movements, but over time escalate into loud thuds, violent door slamming, and demonic grunts and screeches. One night, Katie appears to be in a trance; she gets up, stands beside the bed staring at Micah for two hours, and goes outside, none of which she recalls the next day.

Micah brings home a Ouija board. When the couple leaves the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the board's pointer on its surface, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie is increasingly aggravated by Micah's flippant behavior and pleads to contact the demonologist, but he refuses. The couple finds non-human footsteps on baby powder Micah sprinkled in the hallway; its path leads to a burnt photograph of a young Katie in the attic, thought to have been destroyed in a house fire. Outside intervention is unavailable, as the demonologist is out of the country and Dr. Fredrichs is afraid of making the demon angrier. The next night (20), Katie is pulled out of the bedroom by an unseen force. Micah discovers a bite mark on Katie's back the morning after, motivating him to get out of the house, but Katie abruptly insists on staying.

On night twenty-one, Katie gets out of bed again and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. Katie screams profusely for Micah and he quickly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah screams in pain with loud thuds. After a moment of silence, Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera which is knocked off the tripod, revealing Katie standing in the doorway with blood on her shirt. She crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic snarl, and the scene cuts to black. The epilogue text states Micah's body is discovered by the police, and Katie is missing.

Alternate endings
Once Paramount acquired the film, the original ending was shown at only one public viewing before being scrapped; two new endings were developed, one theatrically released above and the other available as an alternate ending on home releases.[10][11]

Original ending
Katie returns to the bedroom alone, covered in blood and holding a large kitchen knife. She sits on the floor against the bed and rocks back and forth. The next day, Katie's friend Amber leaves a concerned message at 2 pm, visits the house at 9 pm, discovers Micah's body downstairs, and runs away in panic. Thirty minutes later, two policemen enter the house and reach the bedroom where they find the possessed Katie with the knife. Seeing them, Katie suddenly returns to her normal state and asks about Micah. After the attic door slams by itself, one of the officers panics and shoots and kills her. The camera fades to black as the police officers continue searching the house for the source of the sound. An epilogue text appears dedicating the film to the memory of Micah and Katie.

This ending was only shown publicly at the 2007 Screamfest Film Festival and was never released officially by Paramount or Blumhouse since its acquisition. The original version of the film (dubbed the ""Festival Cut"") was later leaked on various forums, which included this ending.[12]

New alternate ending
After killing Micah off-screen, Katie comes back upstairs alone like in the original ending. She closes and locks the bedroom door, approaches the camera and promptly slits her own throat, before collapsing dead. The scene then fades to black.",,"For the horror movie ""Paranormal Activity,"" here are the analyses based on the provided criteria:

1. **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on Katie being subjected to psychological and physical torment by the demon, and she does not gain control or agency over her situation. It is more about her immediate survival rather than empowerment.

In summary, ""Paranormal Activity"" explores themes of gender-based violence and the monstrous feminine, with the main protagonist Katie fitting into a non-traditional role and ultimately facing victimization and death in most of the film’s endings.",5,5,1,1,1,1
Child's Play,1988,Tom Holland,M,Catherine Hicks,F,"A single mother gives her son a beloved doll for his birthday, only to discover that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child%27s_Play_(1988_film),"Detective Mike Norris chases fugitive serial killer Charles Lee Ray through the streets of Chicago and into a toy store. Meanwhile Ray's accomplice, Eddie Caputo, flees the scene. Shot by Norris and dying, Ray performs a voodoo chant to transfer his soul into a nearby Good Guy-brand talking doll. The store is struck by lightning, causing an explosion. Shortly after, Norris finds Ray's lifeless body next to the doll.

Widow Karen Barclay's six-year-old son Andy wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday, but she wasn't able to save up enough to afford one. While at work, her best friend Maggie informs her that a homeless peddler outside has gotten his hands on a Good Guy. After Maggie briefly haggles over the price, Karen excitedly buys the doll and gives it to Andy. Andy is immediately captivated by the doll, who introduces itself as ""Chucky.""

That night, Maggie babysits Andy while Karen goes back to work to cover a shift. Chucky comes to life and attacks Maggie, striking her with a hammer and causing her to fall out of a window to her death. Karen returns home to the crime scene where Norris is serving as lead detective. Norris believes Andy may have been involved in Maggie's death, while Andy tries to claim that Chucky may have been involved. Andy later tells his mother that Chucky told him his real name was ""Charles Lee Ray.""

The next day, Chucky convinces Andy to skip school and take a train-ride to a bad neighborhood. Chucky sneaks into an abandoned home where Caputo is hiding out and kills him in a gas explosion in revenge for abandoning him. Andy is discovered by police and again considered a suspect, and Karen is informed he will be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for observation. Karen returns home with Chucky, and discovers that the doll has been moving and speaking on its own without batteries. Chucky violently comes alive and attacks her before escaping. Karen goes to Norris but he does not believe her story.

Karen finds the peddler and asks for more information, but he attempts to sexually assault her; Norris saves her and forces the peddler to admit that he stole the doll from the destroyed toy store where Norris killed Ray. Norris, still skeptical, is later attacked by Chucky. He shoots the doll, whose wound inexplicably bleeds and causes pain. Chucky escapes to his former voodoo instructor John, demanding answers; John informs him that the longer his soul remains in the doll, the more ""human"" the doll will become. He refuses to help and is subsequently tortured by Chucky with a voodoo doll, forcing him to reveal that in order to escape the doll's body, he must transfer his soul to the first human he revealed his true identity to- Andy. Chucky leaves for Andy as Karen and Norris arrive and find John bleeding to death. Before dying, John tells them that in order to kill Chucky, they must destroy his heart.

Chucky arrives at the psychiatric hospital and kills Andy's doctor with an electroshock therapy device. Andy flees home, where Chucky knocks him out. As Chucky prepares to possess Andy, Karen and Norris arrive. Chucky wounds Norris, but Karen and Andy are able to get the upper hand, setting him on fire. A horribly-burned Chucky attacks again, but Karen shoots his head and several of his limbs off, appearing to kill him. Norris' partner Jack arrives, refusing to believe the trio until Chucky's body bursts through a heat vent and attacks. Norris shoots Chucky's body through the heart, finally killing him. The group leaves to get Norris to the hospital as a traumatized Andy looks back at Chucky's remains.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

Candyman,1992,Bernard Rose,M,Virginia Madsen,F,"The Candyman, a murderous soul with a hook for a hand, is accidentally summoned to reality by a skeptic grad student researching the monster's myth.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candyman_(1992_film),"Helen Lyle is a semiotics graduate student at the University of Illinois Chicago. While researching urban legends, she learns of the Candyman, a spirit who kills anyone that speaks his name five times in front of a mirror. She learns of a recent murder at the Cabrini–Green Homes public housing project and two dozen others that have been attributed by locals to the Candyman. Skeptical, Helen and her friend Bernadette Walsh repeat the Candyman's name to Helen's bathroom mirror, to no avail.

Helen and Bernadette work together on a thesis on how Cabrini-Green residents use the Candyman legend to cope with hardship and inequality. She and Bernadette visit the scene of the most recent murder. There, Helen discovers a room where offerings have been left for the Candyman. Afterwards, they interview the victim's neighbor, Anne-Marie McCoy, a single mother raising her infant son Anthony. Helen and her husband Trevor later have dinner with an expert on the Candyman legend. He explains that the ""Candyman"" was Daniel Robitaille, an African-American man born in the late 1800s as the son of a slave who grew up to become a well-known painter. After he fell in love with and impregnated a white woman, her father sent a lynch mob after him. The mob cut off his right hand and smeared him with honeycomb stolen from an apiary, attracting bees that stung him to death. His corpse was burned in a pyre erected on the site where the Cabrini-Green Homes were eventually built.

When Helen returns to Cabrini-Green, a young boy named Jake tells her of an incident where a developmentally disabled boy was violently castrated by the Candyman in a public bathroom. She goes there to investigate, where a man calling himself the Candyman batters her with a hook. She identifies her attacker to the police, who recognize him as the head of a local gang, and is therefore charged for the murders attributed to Candyman. The real Candyman appears to Helen in a parking garage, hypnotizing her. He explains that due to her discredit of his legend, he must shed innocent blood to perpetuate it. Helen blacks out and awakens in Anne-Marie's apartment, covered in blood, finding Anne-Marie's pet Rottweiler, Annie, decapitated and her son Anthony missing. The police arrive and arrest Helen.

After Trevor bails her out of jail, Helen finds the Candyman in a photograph she took at Cabrini-Green. He breaks into Helen's apartment and cuts her neck, causing her to bleed and pass out. Bernadette arrives at Helen's apartment, and when Helen comes to, she sees that the Candyman has murdered Bernadette. Framed for the crime, Helen is committed to a psychiatric hospital. While being interviewed in preparation for her trial a month later, Helen attempts to prove her innocence by summoning the Candyman, who appears and murders her psychiatrist. Candyman then frees Helen from her restraints, allowing her to escape.

Helen returns to her apartment to find Trevor now living with one of his students, Stacey. Helen confronts him, then flees to Cabrini-Green to rescue Anthony. When she finds the Candyman in his lair, he tells Helen that her surrendering to him will ensure Anthony's safety. Offering Helen immortality, the Candyman opens his coat, revealing a ribcage wreathed in bees. The bees pour out of his mouth and stream down her throat as he kisses her. He vanishes with Anthony, and Helen awakes to discover a mural of the Candyman and his lover, who bears a striking resemblance to her.

The Candyman promises to release Anthony if Helen helps him strike fear into Cabrini-Green's residents. Attempting to feed his legend, the Candyman reneges and attempts to immolate both Helen and Anthony in a pyre. Helen stabs the Candyman with a flaming plank. The flames destroy the Candyman and Helen dies while saving Anthony. The residents, led by Anne-Marie and Jake, pay their respects at Helen's funeral. At home, the grief-stricken and guilt-ridden Trevor looks into the mirror and says Helen's name five times, whereupon Helen's vengeful spirit appears and kills him. A new mural of Helen dressed in white with her hair ablaze appears in the Candyman's lair.

Possessor,2020,Brandon Cronenberg,M,Andrea Riseborough,F,"Tasya Vos, an elite corporate assassin, uses brain-implant technology to take control of other people’s bodies to terminate high profile targets. As she sinks deeper into her latest assignment, Vos becomes trapped inside a mind that threatens to obliterate her.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessor_(film),"In an alternate 2008, Tasya Vos is an assassin who takes control of other people's bodies to carry out her hits. Through an implant installed in the unwitting host's brain, Vos‘ consciousness is inserted into their minds. She returns to her own body by forcing the host to commit suicide at the end of the job, although the movie‘s intro sequence has her deviate from her protocol and struggling to commit suicide by her own gun, getting the host shot by shooting at arriving police forces instead.

Vos struggles with neurological symptoms and increasing detachment from her own identity and cannot fully separate her work from her interactions with her husband, Michael, and son, Ira. She ""practices"" assuming her normal persona the same way she practices impersonating her hosts. Thoughts of violence haunt her domestic life, such as when putting Ira to bed and having sex with Michael.

Vos' handler, retired assassin Girder, is critical of her desire to remain connected to her family and expresses the belief that Vos would be a better killer without personal attachments. In a debriefing session meant to reconnect her with her real identity, Vos sorts through a series of objects associated with personal memories and pauses on a butterfly that she pinned and framed as a child. She tells Girder she feels guilty for killing it.

Despite her fragile mental state and fatigue, Vos agrees to perform a major hit on wealthy CEO John Parse and his daughter, Ava, by possessing Ava's fiancé, Colin Tate. While assuming the host‘s life, the neurological symptoms worsen, but Vos hides this during her handler‘s check-ins. The hit is only a partial success as Ava dies, but not Parse.

Vos attempts to finish the job per protocol by forcing Tate to shoot himself, but again cannot make him pull the trigger. During a dissociative break, in which Vos struggles to remain in control of Tate’s body, he stabs himself in the skull, damaging the implant and causing severe neurological symptoms on Vos‘ own body, causing her internal physical damage. Vos discovers she can neither leave Tate's body, nor overpower his consciousness. Tate regains control, but is severely disoriented, in shock and traumatised from the violence before him, so he flees the crime scene. He seeks refuge with his friend Reeta, while experiencing fragmented memories of Vos’ life.

He kills Reeta while struggling with dissociative memories of the hit on Parse and Ava. Eddie, a co-employee from Tate‘s workplace who reveals himself to be a plant from Vos‘ agency, arrives at the apartment to help Vos regain control and complete Tate's suicide. The attempt fails and Tate kills Eddie during another dissociative episode in which Tate becomes aware of Vos' presence inside his body. His consciousness overpowers hers in a psychic confrontation, giving him access to memories of her husband, child and home.

Tate goes to Vos' home and holds her husband at gunpoint, demanding to know what she did to him. Vos appears inside Tate’s mind and goads Tate into killing Michael. When Michael knocks the gun from Tate's hand, Tate kills him with a meat cleaver, in a similar manner as the movie‘s opening sequence‘s job. Moments later, Ira stabs Tate in the throat, killing him, also reminiscent to the opening sequence‘s stabbing. Vos uses Tate's last moments to shoot Ira dead, who is then revealed to also have been a host.

Vos returns to her own body and discovers that it was Girder who had taken control of Ira. With Ira and Michael both dead, she is now free of all human attachments, as Girder wanted.

In another debriefing, Vos sorts through her personal objects again. She contemplates and recognizes the butterfly, but does not express any guilt for killing it. Girder smiles and replies, ""Very good.""

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

**1. Gender based violence:**
The movie explores violent interactions deeply personal to the female protagonist, Tasya Vos. She suffers significant psychological and physical threats due to the nature of her profession, which involves assassinations. This ties back to the theme of gender-based violence, as she is subjected to brutal circumstances throughout the film.

**2. Motherhood:**
Though not a traditional representation of motherhood, the narrative does deal with Tasya's relationships with her husband, Michael, and son, Ira. Her inability to disengage from her violent work life impacts her role as a mother significantly by the end of the movie; her family ends up dead, freeing her from those maternal connections.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

**5. Other:**
Tasya Vos is an assassin—a professional role that doesn't neatly fit into traditionally female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. Her expertise and job place her in a position of power, albeit a tragically complex one.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?

**1. Monstruous feminine (possessed body, castrator):**
Tasya can be interpreted as embodying the ""monstruous feminine"" archetype, particularly as a possessed body and castrator. Her profession involves taking over others' bodies to commit murders, a form of possession. In the final psychological confrontation, she manipulates Tate into violence, which empowers this interpretation.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?

**2. Survives:**
Tasya Vos survives at the end of the movie.

### Female Victimization or Female Empowerment

**1. Victimization:**
Despite Tasya Vos's powerful role as an assassin, the movie leans more towards her victimization. The story continually subjects her to severe psychological and physical threats. She loses her family and ultimately her sense of self, primarily to the demands of her manipulative handler. Her autonomy is persistently compromised, pointing more toward her victimization than empowerment.",2,5,1,1,2,1
Run,2020,Aneesh Chaganty,M,Sarah Paulson,F,"Chloe, a teenager who is confined to a wheelchair, is homeschooled by her mother, Diane. Chloe soon becomes suspicious of her mother and begins to suspect that she may be harboring a dark secret.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(2020_American_film),"A woman named Diane Sherman gives birth to a premature baby, whom she goes to see lying in an incubator, surrounded by the hospital staff. Years later, Diane lives a quiet life with her now teenage daughter, Chloe. Due to the circumstances of her birth, Chloe suffers from arrhythmia, hemochromatosis, asthma, and diabetes, as well as paralysis in her legs. She uses a wheelchair, takes multiple medications daily, and is homeschooled by her mother. Chloe desires to go to college, something Diane seems to support, but has received no responses for her applications.

One morning, while looking through a bag of groceries for chocolate, Chloe finds a prescription bottle of green pills with Diane's name on the label. However, when Chloe later inspects the bottle, she finds a label bearing her name has been pasted over the original. She tries to research the name of the pills—Trigoxin—but discovers the house has no internet connection, unaware Diane is watching her with the router unplugged. The next day, Chloe dials a random number from her mother's bedroom phone, and asks the answering stranger to look up the drug. He tells her it is a heart medication and that all pictures of the medication show a small red pill.

Later, while pretending to go to the bathroom at the movie theater, Chloe rushes to the pharmacy across the street. The pharmacist at the desk reveals the green pills are actually a relaxant called Ridocaine, which had been only approved for dogs and, if taken by a human, could paralyze their legs. Chloe begins to hyperventilate before Diane runs in and sedates her to take her home.

Chloe wakes up in bed and finds her bedroom door locked from the outside, while Diane is out running an errand. She breaks out of her room by dragging herself onto the roof, eventually making her way to her mother's bedroom and breaking the window with a soldering iron and water. She begins to have an asthma attack and only barely manages to crawl to her room to retrieve her inhaler. She tries to use her automated wheelchair ramp to go downstairs, but finds that Diane has cut the power cord. She is forced to throw her wheelchair down the stairs and accidentally falls, sustaining minor injuries but also discovering that she can move one of her toes, due to having not taken Ridocaine in the last few days.

Outside down the road, Chloe sees a mail truck and rushes to stop it; she explains her situation to Tom, the postal worker, who agrees to help her. Diane pulls up and Chloe asks him to contact the police. Tom confronts Diane and tells her she can't take Chloe home. When closing up the van to take Chloe to the police station, Diane appears and stabs Tom in the neck with a syringe. Chloe hyperventilates again and then blacks out. When she awakens, she is in the basement of her house, with her wheelchair chained to a steel pole as Diane drags Tom's body through her hallway.

While in the basement, Chloe discovers her childhood photos, which show her walking, as well as a death certificate for a girl named Chloe who died two hours and eleven minutes after her birth, as well as an article about a couple who had their baby stolen from the same hospital. She also finds college acceptance letters that were hidden from her. When Diane enters, Chloe accuses her of poisoning her and demands the truth. Diane insists everything she ever did was to help and protect Chloe and exclaims that she saved her. Diane then fills a syringe with paint thinner, saying it will make her forget. Terrified, Chloe crawls away and locks herself in a closet. She then swallows a bottle of organophosphate, forcing Diane to rush her to the hospital.

Chloe wakes up in a hospital bed, intubated and barely able to move. Diane insists that her ""daughter"" be discharged, but the doctors refuse until Chloe has been evaluated by a mental health professional. Chloe signals to a nurse, who brings her a crayon and paper. While Chloe is attempting to write ""MOM"" on the paper, a code blue is called and the nurse rushes out. Armed with a handgun, Diane then sneaks in and ties Chloe to a wheelchair to escape; the nurse finds the bed empty and alerts hospital security. As Diane tries to find an exit, Chloe is able to move her foot and hold the chair in place. Diane begs her to come home with her, but Chloe replies that she doesn't need her. Diane aims her gun at security guards, yelling ""We are going home!"" as she is cornered and shot in the arm, causing her to fall down the stairs.

Seven years later, Chloe still relies on her wheelchair, although is able to walk short distances using a cane. She visits Diane in a correctional facility, who is confined to a bed in the infirmary ward. Chloe then talks about the life she had built for herself: her husband, Ara, daughter, Annie, and work. She mentions that Annie has a preference in grandparents, implying that Chloe had been reunited with her birth parents. She takes out three plastic-wrapped Ridocaine pills that were concealed under her tongue, and tells Diane that she still loves her before asking her to open her mouth wide.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

1) **Motherhood**: The theme of motherhood is central to the film, with Diane's extreme and twisted sense of maternal care leading her to imprison and control Chloe under the guise of protecting her. The revelations regarding Chloe's true parentage and Diane's earlier actions add further complexity to this theme.
   
2) **Gender Based Violence**: Diane's actions are a form of psychological and physical abuse, fitting into the category of gender-based violence. She manipulates, drugs, and physically restrains Chloe, embodying an abusive dynamic often seen in real-world cases of female victimization.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

1) **Adolescent Girl**: Chloe is a teenage girl, homeschooled by Diane due to her numerous health conditions. Her role is defined by her youth and developmental stage, compounded by her struggles for independence and autonomy.

### Monstrous-Feminine 

1) **Monstrous Mother**: Diane embodies the archetype of the ""monstrous mother,"" using her role to justify extreme control over Chloe's life. Her initial actions, such as kidnapping Chloe and falsifying medical conditions, align her with the concept of the monstrous-feminine as described by Barbara Creed.

### Fate of the Protagonist

2) **Survives**: Chloe survives through the end of the film. Despite her harrowing experiences and the ongoing struggle with her physical limitations, she ultimately manages to build a life for herself and gains a semblance of autonomy.

### Focus of the Story

1) **Empowerment**: The film ultimately leans towards female empowerment. Despite the extreme victimization Chloe experiences for much of the runtime, she uses her cunning and resilience to uncover the truth and escape Diane's control. She gains agency, pursues her own needs and desires, and establishes a life independent of her abuser, fulfilling the criteria for a story of empowerment.

Overall, ""Run"" portrays a disturbing, yet ultimately hopeful narrative of a young woman's struggle against a deeply controlling maternal figure, highlighting themes of twisted motherhood and abuse, but also emphasizing resilience and the quest for autonomy and empowerment.",1,1,1,2,2,1
The Nun II,2023,Michael Chaves,M,Taissa Farmiga,F,"In 1956 France, a priest is violently murdered, and Sister Irene begins to investigate. She once again comes face-to-face with a powerful evil.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nun_II,"In 1956, Father Noiret and his altar boy Jacques perform their daily chores in their church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death before a terrified Jacques.

Four years following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has befriended a young Irish student named Sophie and her mother, Kate, who is a teacher at the school. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him. She is dispatched by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe, attributed to the demon Valak, due to her previous experience with the demon. She travels to Tarascon with Sister Debra, a young novice.

In Tarascon, Irene is haunted by Valak. Debra receives Noiret's rosary from Jacques. At school, Sophie is bullied by classmates and locked in the deconsecrated sealed-off chapel. The bully points out the goat on the stained-glass window, claiming that the devil appears when the sun shines through and turns the goat's eyes red. One night, the headmistress encounters a sleepwalking Maurice and is killed by Valak.

Irene and Debra travel to the Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian. He explains that Valak was an angel rejected by God and the emblem on Noiret's rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire, she miraculously did not burn; her eyes were gouged out, but her family recovered them. The librarian suggests the demon is killing St. Lucy's descendants because it wants this powerful relic, last known to be stored in a former monastery-turned-winery. The winery became the present-day boarding school.

At the school, Irene and Debra face off against a possessed Maurice. They use a flashlight to make the stained-glass goat's eyes glow red. The red light acts as a laser, pointing to where the eyes of St. Lucy are buried. Irene finds the relic and the stained-glass goat vanishes, reappearing in real life as a demonic creature.

Maurice attacks Irene and causes the bell tower to collapse. Valak appears, lifts Irene in the air, and sets her ablaze like Father Noiret. Irene, however, does not burn as she is a descendant of St. Lucy, able to harness the power associated with the relic. Irene and Debra pray the Words of Institution as the old barrels of wine in the room become the blood of Christ, banishing the demon and freeing Maurice of possession.

The next morning, Irene looks on, concerned, as she watches Maurice walking with Sophie and Kate.

Martyrs,2008,Pascal Laugier,M,Morjana Alaoui,F,"A young woman’s quest for revenge against the people who kidnapped and tortured her as a child leads her and her best friend, also a victim of child abuse, on a terrifying journey into a living hell of depravity.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyrs_(2008_film),"In 1971, young Lucie Jurin escapes from a disused slaughterhouse where she has been imprisoned and tortured for more than a year. She is placed in an orphanage, where she befriends Anna Assaoui, whom Lucie tells about her past and her torturers, whom she can't remember. One day, Anna finds Lucie bleeding in a bathtub with cuts on her arm. Lucie begs Anna not to tell anyone, and Anna hugs her, telling her that she shouldn't cut herself. Lucie responds that it wasn't her who'd done it. One night, Lucie is attacked by a disfigured, demonic woman.

Fifteen years later, Lucie bursts into the home of a seemingly normal family, the Belfonds — Gabrielle, her husband, and their children Marie and Antoine — and kills them with a shotgun. Before killing Antoine, Lucie asks him if he knows what his parents had done. Lucie believes that they were involved in her torture as a child, having recognized their faces from a newspaper item about Marie's competitive swimming. She calls Anna and gives her the address of the house. While waiting for Anna to arrive, Lucie is startled by noises in the house and shoots her last bullet after hearing a door slam. A naked, demonic woman attacks Lucie, cutting her back with a knife. While hiding from the woman in a closet, Lucie hears rattling and has a vision of herself as a child, bound to a chair, rocking before being smothered by a man's hand. Lucie peeks out from the closet and has her hand stabbed by the woman. She runs outside and collides with Anna, who wraps Lucie's hand with her scarf and notices the cuts on her back. Anna goes inside the house, despite Lucie's warning that ""she"" is inside. Anna is horrified by the carnage inside, but ultimately decides to help Lucie clean the crime scene and dispose of the bodies. Anna kisses Lucie, who pushes her away and asks what she is doing. Lucie is once again attacked by the woman, and hides with Anna in a bedroom. The lights flicker from a storm outside, and Lucie has a vision of her escape from her torturer, in the process of which she ran from a pleading fellow prisoner who reached out for Lucie. The vision ends and Lucie finds herself locked in the bedroom without Anna. Anna has discovered Gabrielle alive and tries to help her escape, but Lucie catches them and beats Gabrielle to death with a hammer. Lucie is again attacked by the demonic woman, but Anna only sees Lucie hurting herself; the demonic woman resembles the victim that Lucie left behind at the slaughterhouse and is a psychological manifestation of Lucie's guilt. Lucie then runs outside and kills herself by slitting her own throat.

The following morning, Anna, while on the phone with her estranged abusive mother, discovers a secret passageway in the home's living room, leading to a subterranean chamber containing illuminated photographs of torture and a living brutalized and emaciated woman, proving that Lucie was right about the Belfonds. Anna attempts to help the woman, who is hysterical and nonverbal. Anna removes a steel blindfold that has been stapled to the woman's skull and helps bathe her, only to later find her mutilating her arm with a knife. A group of people arrive at the house, kill the woman, and capture Anna. The group's leader, identified only as Mademoiselle, explains that they belong to a secret society seeking to discover the secrets of the afterlife through the creation of ""martyrs"". They do this by capturing young women and inflicting on them systematic acts of torture, in the belief that their physical suffering will result in a transcendental insight into the world beyond. So far, the group has only produced ""victims"" who succumbed to the pain and are unable to speak, but the group is determined to create martyrs who accept their suffering and report their visions of the afterlife.

Anna becomes the group's latest subject and has her pants removed. After a period of being brutally beaten and degraded in her underwear, she is told that she has progressed further than any other test subject and reached the ""final stage."" She is flayed alive, a procedure that she survives, and reportedly enters an ""ecstatic"" state. Mademoiselle arrives, eager to learn Anna's secrets, and Anna whispers into her ear. Members of the society then gather at the house to pay veneration to Anna for her martyrdom and to hear Mademoiselle's announcement of the groundbreaking testimony. While waiting for Mademoiselle, an assistant asks her from outside her door if what Anna said was clear. She unequivocally confirms and asks him in turn if he can imagine what comes after death. After he says no, Mademoiselle abruptly produces a handgun, tells him to ""keep doubting"" and kills herself.

An intertitle explains that ""martyr"" is Greek for ""witness"". The film ends with a shot of Anna lying catatonic on a table seemingly looking at something far away. During the credits, home movies of Anna and Lucie as children are shown.","Critic Maitland McDonagh notes that the film contains the theme of the Roman Catholic notions of sainthood and martyrdom in its exploration of spiritual transcendence via physical pain.[6] Laugier himself stated that he intended to make the film's audience ""feel real pain"" and to ""share it as part of an honest process [of] communion...  It was a very Catholic process. I have a very Catholic mind.""[7] In a 2009 interview with Electric Sheep magazine, he stated that he feels ""the Western world is sick... Horror cinema allowed me to express this in a very direct way. Martyrs is almost a work of prospective fiction that shows a dying world, almost like a pre-apocalypse. It’s a world where evil triumphed a long time ago, where consciences have died out under the reign of money and where people spend their time hurting one another. It’s a metaphor, of course, but the film describes things that are not that far from what we’re experiencing today.""

The film's graphic violence resulted in its being associated with the New French Extremity movement, an association Laugier vocally denounced.[7] Literary professor Gwendolyn Audrey Foster similarly challenges the sentiment that Martyrs belongs in this category, writing that its ""nihilism is complete and impossible to dismiss, making it a far different experience from other extreme horror films"", also citing Laugier's statement that the film exists in a world ""in which evil triumphed a long time ago"".[8] Foster also notes Laugier's intent to force the film's audience to bear witness to the pain of the violence represented, writing that its viewers ""become martyrs in a sense"".","### Themes Related to Womanhood

1. **Gender Based Violence**: The film graphically depicts physical and psychological torture directed primarily at young women, exploring themes of control and suffering.
2. **Female Empowerment**: Despite its nihilistic tone, Anna's character endures extreme physical and psychological torment, showing resilience and ultimately achieving a form of spiritual transcendence.

### Role of the Main Protagonist

1. **Adolescent Girl**: Lucie is introduced as a young girl who has suffered traumatic abuse, and her childhood trauma plays a significant role in the story.
2. **Other**: Anna's role does not fit neatly into traditional categories. She transitions from being a supportive friend to a ""martyr,"" undergoing extreme sacrifices and suffering, making her role more complex and multifaceted than the typical vulnerable archetypes.

### Portrayal as a Monster

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Lucie's demonic hallucinations portray her as embodying aspects of the Monstrous-Feminine, particularly through her psychological torment and violent actions. Anna's transformation also fits the Monstrous-Feminine archetype as she becomes a ""survivor"" and ""witness"" through extreme suffering.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist

1. **Survives**: Anna survives the flaying process although she is left in a catatonic state by the end of the movie.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment

1. **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on physical and psychological victimization experienced by Lucie and Anna. They are subjected to extreme torture with limited agency or autonomy. While Anna achieves a form of transcendence, it is under conditions of extreme duress and not by her own volition, thus limiting the narrative of empowerment.",2,5,2,1,2,2
The House,2022,Paloma Baeza,F,Mia Goth,F,"Across different eras, a poor family, an anxious developer and a fed-up landlady become tied to the same mysterious house in this animated dark comedy.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_House_(2022_film),"I – And heard within, a lie is spun
A young girl named Mabel lives with her father Raymond, mother Penny, and newborn sister Isobel in relative poverty. After a visit from wealthy, condescending relatives, Raymond wanders drunk into the forest at night and encounters the mysterious architect Mr. Van Schoonbeek. The following morning, Van Schoonbeek's employee Mr. Thomas visits the family and convinces Raymond and Penny to accept Van Schoonbeek's offer to move into a new luxurious house built for them at no charge.

After the family moves in, Mabel notices several peculiar things about the house and the workers constantly refitting it, but her parents are mesmerized by the house and its luxuries. Raymond becomes increasingly obsessed with the house's fireplace, which he constantly fails to light up, while Penny spends more and more time sewing drapes. Mabel becomes further put off when her parents don attire designed by Van Schoonbeek which resembles the furniture they adore (a chair and curtains).

Exploring the house one night, Mabel and Isobel find themselves lost in the maze it has become, eventually stumbling upon despondent Thomas. Drunk and ashamed, Thomas confesses that he is an actor following a script provided by Van Schoonbeek. Meanwhile, Raymond is finally able to light a fire by burning the family's old possessions, including his father's chair and Mabel's dollhouse. When the sisters finally reunite with their parents, they find Raymond and Penny turned into furniture—Raymond into a chair and Penny into curtains. As the fire expands, the parents urge their daughters to escape. Using the curtains to climb out a window while their parents burn alive, Mabel and Isobel escape before watching the smoking house from a distance as the sun rises.

II – Then lost is truth that can't be won
The story is set in a world populated by anthropomorphic rats, and the house is now settled in a developed city street and about to go up for sale. The developer renovating the house recently laid off his entire construction crew to reduce costs and must do all the work himself. Discovering the house has been infested by fur beetles and larvae, he uses copious amounts of boric acid to get rid of them, to no avail.

On the day of the viewing, the guests are unimpressed by the house, but a strangely proportioned couple remains, expressing a strong interest in buying the house. Unwilling to risk the sale, the developer lets them stay the night. Over the next few days, the odd couple remains firmly settled in the house, the bugs return in force, and the bank keeps demanding repayment of the developer's business loan. The developer decides to stop indulging the couple, only for many members of their family to show up wanting to enter the house. He tries to call the police, who instead caution him for his constant, overly familiar phone calls to his dentist, who the film had led the audience to believe was his romantic partner. The dentist is also ready to take the developer to court if he telephones him again.

At his wit's end, the developer tries to use the boric acid on the couple, but he inhales a mouthful and faints. He survives but is reduced to a catatonic state. The couple picks the developer up from the hospital and brings him home, where their family welcomes him back, many of them now sporting additional limbs. The final scene shows the family ravaging the inside of the house—climbing up the walls and chewing through everything. The developer, having regressed to animal-like intelligence, briefly emerges from the remains of the oven to eat garbage before retreating underground.

III – Listen again and seek the sun
In a world that suffered an apocalyptic flood and is populated by anthropomorphic cats, the house is surrounded by water which keeps rising. Rosa, the landlord who cherishes the memories of her days growing up in the house, dreams of restoring it to its former glory. However, she struggles financially; and her only tenants, fisherman Elias and hippie Jen, do not pay rent despite her insistence; she consistently ignores their attempts to address the rising water.

When Jen's ""spirit partner"" Cosmos (a craftsman) arrives to visit, Rosa enlists him to work on the house; but is infuriated to find out he has instead been tearing up the house's floorboards to build a boat for Elias. As Cosmos continues to refit the house against Rosa's wishes, Rosa argues with Elias; hurt that he wishes to leave, while he accuses her of being afraid to do the same. He later departs on the makeshift boat.

As the water and mist continue to seep into the house and Jen prepares to leave the house with Cosmos, she puts Rosa into a dream-like trance, in which Rosa sees the house destroyed and her friends abandoning her. Emerging from the vision, she sees Jen and Cosmos sailing away, calling for her to join them; but the boat is too far away. Remembering a large lever Cosmos had built, she pushed it, transforming the house into a seaworthy vessel. Encouraged by Jen, Cosmos, and a returning Elias, Rosa takes control of the house ship, escaping as the floods destroy the surrounding foundations, and the four sail out into the ocean.",,"### Section I – And heard within, a lie is spun

Alien³,1992,David Fincher,M,Sigourney Weaver,F,"After escaping with Newt and Hicks from the alien planet, Ripley crash lands on Fiorina 161, a prison planet and host to a correctional facility. Unfortunately, although Newt and Hicks do not survive the crash, a more unwelcome visitor does. The prison does not allow weapons of any kind, and with aid being a long time away, the prisoners must simply survive in any way they can.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_3,"Following the events of Aliens, an egg hatches aboard the Colonial Marine spaceship Sulaco, releasing a facehugger. A fire starts and the ship's computer launches an escape pod containing Ellen Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and the damaged android Bishop; all four are in cryonic stasis. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina ""Fury"" 161, a foundry and maximum-security correctional facility inhabited by male inmates with a genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior. The inmates recover the crashed pod and its passengers. The facehugger approaches inmate Thomas Murphy's dog, Spike.

Ripley is awakened by Clemens, the prison's chief medical officer, who informs her that she is the sole survivor. The prison warden, Harold Andrews, says that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley insists that Clemens perform an autopsy on Newt and that her and Hicks's bodies be subsequently burned, fearing that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. The funeral proceeds with spiritual leader Dillon delivering a speech as the deceased are dropped into the furnace. Elsewhere in the prison, a quadrupedal alien bursts from Spike.

Ripley finds the damaged Bishop in the prison's garbage dump before being cornered by four inmates and almost gang-raped. After being saved by Dillon, Ripley returns to the infirmary and re-activates Bishop, who, before asking to be permanently shut down, confirms that a Facehugger came with them to Fiorina, under knowledge of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Growing to full size, the alien kills Murphy, Boggs, and Rains. It also returns outcast prisoner Golic to his previously psychopathic state. Ripley informs Andrews of her previous Xenomorph encounters[a] and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. However, the facility is without weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by Weyland-Yutani.

The Alien ambushes Ripley and Clemens in the prison infirmary, killing him, and cornering her. However, it mysteriously spares her and retreats. Ripley rushes to the cafeteria to warn the others. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the Alien. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the Alien. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates die. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and sees the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the aliens into biological weapons.

The Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, so Ripley begs Dillon to do it; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the Alien first. They form a plan to lure the Alien into the foundry's molding facility, trap it, and drown it in molten lead. The bait-and-chase plan results in the deaths of every remaining prisoner but Dillon and Morse. Dillon sacrifices himself to position the Alien towards the mold as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. Although the Alien is covered in molten metal, it escapes the mold. Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, blowing the Alien apart from thermal shock.

The Weyland–Yutani team arrives, including commandos and a man who looks identical to Bishop who says he is Bishop's creator.[b] He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Alien Queen embryo, claiming it will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland–Yutani team shoots Morse in the leg to stop him; Aaron strikes the Bishop look-alike with a wrench and is shot dead by the commandos. Ignoring pleas to give them the embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace, holding captive the infant queen as it erupts from her. The facilities are closed down. Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's final logbook recording from the Nostromo plays.",,"### Movie Title: Alien³

The couple find themselves in a violent struggle, in which they go beyond what either of them thought capable in order to survive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strangers_(2008_film),"James Hoyt and Kristen McKay arrive at James' isolated childhood summer home after attending a wedding. The couple is distraught after Kristen turned down James’ marriage proposal. James calls his friend Mike and asks to pick him up in the morning. The couple attempt to have sex, but are interrupted by a knock at the door. They answer to find a young woman, asking if Tamara is home. James dismisses her, and builds a fire for Kristen.

James goes to purchase cigarettes for Kristen. The woman from earlier returns, asking the same question. Kristen dismisses her again. A masked man is seen silently watching her from inside the house.

Kristen notices the smoke alarm she'd dropped on the floor earlier is now sitting on a chair and realizes someone is in the house. She finds her cellphone missing and is horrified when the front door is forced ajar. The young woman, now wearing a mask, peers into the house. She locks the door and retreats.

James returns and reassures Kristen that nobody is in the house. They see the young masked woman, Dollface, watching their house from outside. He attempts to get his cellphone from their car but finds it ransacked. The couple attempts to escape in the car, but are abruptly stopped when the masked brunette woman rear-ends them in a pickup truck.

Mike arrives and James accidentally shoots him dead. He remembers an old radio transmitter in a barn on the property. He leaves and the Man in the Mask knocks him unconscious, and eventually does the same to Kristen inside the house. The couple awakens tied to chairs in the living room. Kristen demands an explanation for the intruders' actions, to which Dollface replies, ""Because you were home.""

The two boys come upon the house, where they discover the bloodied bodies of Kristen and James. Kristen startles one of the boys by grabbing his hand and screaming, before they call the police.

","Film scholar Kevin Wetmore noted the film's portrayal of violence as a reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: ""Death is a random act in post-9/11 horror—the result of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, as the cliché goes. Unlike in eighties slasher horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, and having premarital sex is often a forerunner to being killed by the killer(s); [here], death is random and unrelated to one's behavior.""[9]

In The Horror Show Guide: The Ultimate Frightfest of Movies, Mike Mayo noted the film's ""grim realism,"" writing that the main characters ""could have wandered out of a gloomy Ingmar Bergman film,"" ultimately branding the film as an example of ""naturalistic domestic horror"" akin to Michael Haneke's Funny Games.[10]

The film has also been noted by scholar Philip Simpson as highlighting ""the divide between the underprivileged and privileged classes,"" as well as for its inversion of commonly-held beliefs about violence in urban areas and pastoral ethics: ""The Strangers, as many horror films do ... undermines the conventional notion of rural society as a simpler, crime-free place. One might call the narrative sensibility informing The Strangers 'pastoral paranoia', in that danger lurks among the rough folk of the country rather than the suburbs and cities. Of course, it may be that provincial violence is a result of contamination, or in other words that the kind of stranger-upon-stranger violence typically associated with urban life metastasizes to the rural, a phenomenon noted by Louis Wirth.""[11]

In his book Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film (2014), scholar Tony Williams notes the film's setting within a 1970s-era home as representative of an ""American tradition of violence that is random and without any coherent explanation."" Additionally, Williams reads the three masked assailants as metaphors for the ""repressed and unresolved tensions affecting the couple inside the house.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood

### Role of the Main Protagonist

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,2014,Ana Lily Amirpour,F,Sheila Vand,F,"In the Iranian ghost-town Bad City, a place that reeks of death and loneliness, the townspeople are unaware they are being stalked by a lonesome vampire.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Girl_Walks_Home_Alone_at_Night,"A hard-working young Iranian man named Arash lives with and takes care of his heroin-addicted father, Hossein. They are harassed by a ruthless, drug-dealing pimp named Saeed, who seizes the young man's prized car in exchange for money the father owes him. In a crime of opportunity, Arash steals a pair of diamond earrings from the wealthy young woman he works for, Shaydah.

Saeed comes across a strange young woman in a chador at night. She persuades Saeed to take her back to his apartment. While there, she grows long fangs and first bites off his finger, then goes for his neck, killing him. As she leaves, she passes by Arash, who has come to offer the earrings for his car. He finds Saeed dead, and takes back his car keys along with a suitcase of drugs and cash. Arash decides to sell the drugs, allowing him to quit his job working for Shaydah. Later, he goes to a costume party at a nightclub dressed up as Dracula, where he is persuaded by Shaydah into taking one of the ecstasy pills he is selling. Under the influence, he becomes disoriented, and ends up lost at night on the street.

The woman with the chador spends her time listening to music alone in her apartment, skateboarding, or bedeviling pedestrians at night, until she comes across the lost Arash. He shows vulnerability and compassion, and she takes him to her home, where they listen to music, and she resists his exposed neck. They meet the next night, and she says that he does not know the terrible things she has done. He is unfazed, gives her the earrings and, at her request, pierces her ears with a safety pin, but she eventually leaves.

Atti, a prostitute who worked for Saeed, is followed at night by the woman, and they retreat to the prostitute's apartment. The woman gives Atti the payment Saeed owed her. They have a conversation during which the woman realizes that Atti no longer remembers what it is to desire. She leaves.

Suffering from heroin withdrawal, Hossein has an episode where he believes that Arash's cat is his dead wife. Infuriated by his father, Arash gives him drugs and money and throws him out, telling him to take the cat with him. Hossein goes to Atti and forces her to take heroin with him. They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells the woman to take the cat and leave.

The following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the woman's apartment and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death. Arash and the woman drive off together, but he pulls off to the side of the road, angry and unsure about what to do. He eventually gets back in the car and the two continue their trip onwards.","Director Ana Lily Amirpour, regarding the mythology of the vampire, has stated that: ""A vampire is so many things: serial killer, a romantic, a historian, a drug addict – they're sort of all these things in one.""[8] The film examines these facets of a vampire as described by Amirpour in a variety of ways.

The film's protagonist, The Girl, is a sort-of antihero vigilante with a taste for bad men. As a vampire, she is able to roam the streets at night without being concerned for her safety, subverting the implications of the film's title.[9] She is the perpetrator, not the victim, and possesses agency and power that would not be typically reserved for her in an environment such as Bad City. In this way, the film has feminist leanings.

Rockabilly, a gender-bending, minor background character who exists on the fringe of Bad City throughout the duration of the movie, acts as a silent observer to the events around them. Director Amirpour states, ""If there's one political thing [in the film], it's not the chador, it's Rockabilly, because it's not okay to be gay in Iran.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Gender-Based Violence**: The film deals with themes of abuse and exploitation, exemplified by the treatment of Atti, the prostitute. The girl, as a vampire, preys on men who embody these violent tendencies, thus reversing the common narrative of women as victims of gender-based violence.
2. **Female Sexuality**: The girl’s interactions, particularly with Arash, explore her autonomy and control over her own body and desires. Her actions and choices reflect themes of sexual agency and a subversion of typical female sexuality roles.

### Role of the Female Protagonist:
5. **Other**: The girl doesn’t fit neatly into the traditional categories. She is a vampire and an antihero vigilante, roles that imbue her with significant power and autonomy. Unlike a mother, housewife, adolescent girl, or professional related to beauty or caretaking, her role defies conventional definitions of femininity and vulnerability.

### Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster:
1. **Monstruous Feminine**: The girl is portrayed as a vampire, a classic representation of the monstruous-feminine archetype. She embodies aspects of both the vampire and the witch, challenging patriarchal views by being a potent, dangerous figure who asserts control over men who exemplify toxic masculinity.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist:
2. **Survives**: By the end of the movie, the girl survives and leaves with Arash. Her continuing existence and uncertain journey ahead underline her survival and resilience.

### Focus of the Story: Female Victimization vs. Female Empowerment:
2. **Empowerment**: The girl’s character arc embodies empowerment. She roams freely, exerts her will, and takes action against male aggressors. The story is more about her taking control over her own narrative and destiny, ultimately portraying a powerful, autonomous figure rather than a victim.

Overall, ""A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night"" subverts many traditional horror tropes, presenting a strong, empowered female protagonist who challenges societal norms and operates outside conventional female roles.",3,5,1,2,2,2

Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who explains that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects to achieve their goals, and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Unable to exorcise the demon, Father Perez decides to take the doll to seek help from the Warrens. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.

Father Perez is hospitalized, When John checks on him, the priest warns him that the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul.

Gerald's Game,2017,Mike Flanagan,M,Carla Gugino,F,"When her husband's sex game goes wrong, Jessie (who is handcuffed to a bed in a remote lake house) faces warped visions, dark secrets and a dire choice.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald%27s_Game_(film),"Jessie and Gerald Burlingame arrive at an isolated lake house in Fairhope, Alabama, for a romantic getaway. They come across a stray dog on the drive over; Jessie wants to help it but Gerald objects. While Gerald takes Viagra, Jessie cuts up a raw steak from the refrigerator and calls out for the dog to eat it. Gerald sees this and chastises her for it as the steak was expensive Kobe beef, but decides to allow her to leave the steak out. They enter the house and Gerald leaves the door open behind them. Inside, she changes into a new slip and Gerald restrains her with a set of handcuffs locked to the bedposts. He begins to enact a stranger rape fantasy; she half-heartedly plays along but becomes uncomfortable, telling him to stop and uncuff her. After a heated argument in which he accuses her of not trying to rekindle their relationship, Gerald dies of a heart attack, falling on top of Jessie and leaving her trapped in the handcuffs.

A few hours pass. The dog enters through the open door of the house. Jessie tries to scare it away, but it bites a chunk out of Gerald's arm and eats it. Gerald stands up and begins talking; when Jessie notices his body remains on the floor, she realizes she is hallucinating. He taunts her about the truths of their strained marriage and his erectile dysfunction. He informs her that she is beginning to suffer from dehydration and fatigue. Jessie hallucinates a more self-assured version of herself, who explains things about her and Gerald that she never had the courage to acknowledge. The two hallucinations trigger her to remember the glass of water Gerald had left on the shelf above the bed, which she is able to reach; when she cannot drink it, she rolls the shopping tag she had torn from her slip into a drinking straw to reach the water.

Jessie falls asleep. The dog appears to be startled by footsteps in the house and runs out of the house barking. Jessie wakes up in the dark, and sees a deformed obscured figure who reveals a bag of bones and trinkets. She refuses to believe the figure is real but Gerald says the figure is Death waiting to take her, pointing out that he must have been real because the dog ran out of the house. Gerald begins to call Jessie ""Mouse"", which triggers a memory of her father Tom, who affectionately referred to her as ""Mouse"". When she was 12, her family went on a vacation to see a solar eclipse from a boat. Jessie was scared of going on the water, so she chose to stay back to her mother's frustration and Tom agreed to watch her while the rest of her family went out on the boat. During the eclipse, Tom asked Jessie to sit on his lap, supposedly reminiscing about Jessie's early childhood, but began masturbating while Jessie was on his lap watching the eclipse. Tom manipulated Jessie afterward to cover up the abuse, pretending that he intended to tell her mother what happened but subtly implying that her mother would blame Jessie for it. Near the end of their conversation, he admitted that he did a ""shameful thing"", but could not look at her when saying that. Gerald points out that Jessie never told him about this. Gerald and hallucination Jessie taunt that she never recovered from the assault, and that she married a man just like her father.

During her childhood memory, Jessie hallucinates the deformed man licking her foot. She comes to and realizes it was the dog licking her foot and kicks it away. Gerald points out that it is only a matter of time before the dog stops eating his dead body and goes for hers. Gerald calls the deformed man ""the man made of moonlight"", and points out a bloody footprint on the floor, making Jessie realize the figure may have been real.

Jessie speaks to her child persona, who asks her to remember what happened afterwards. She recalls eating dinner with her family and gripping a water glass so tight that it shattered and cut her hand in the process after her mother asked how her time was with Tom while everyone else was on the boat. Her mother is shocked and seems to suspect something happened, but still does nothing, and Tom takes her aside to clean up her wound. In present day, Jessie hallucinates Tom and her younger self tending to the wound in the sink nearby the bed, and she realizes the only way to escape is to break the water glass, cut her wrist and use the blood as lubricant to free one of her hands from the cuff. She smashes the water glass, cuts her wrist, and peels back the skin, allowing her bloody hand to slip through the cuff. She first reaches for the phone only to see that the battery is dead. She reaches the key and unlocks her other hand. She bandages her wrist with sanitary pads but passes out from blood loss and fatigue. When she awakes, the ""man made of moonlight"" is at the end of the hall. Delirious, she removes her wedding ring and gives it to him for his trinket bag before leaving. She makes it to her car and drives away but hallucinates the deformed figure again, who whispers ""Mouse"" into her ear, and crashes into a tree. People from a nearby house emerge to help.

Six months later, Jessie is writing a letter to her 12-year-old self. She describes how she had pretended to have amnesia over the ordeal of being trapped, avoiding painful questions. She used some of Gerald's life insurance to start a foundation for victims of sexual abuse, but each night the ""man made of moonlight"" still appears before her as she falls asleep. She is disturbed by the fact that despite the police thoroughly searching the lake house, they were never able to find her wedding ring. She learns from the news that the ""man made of moonlight"" was in fact a serial killer and grave robber with acromegaly called Raymond Andrew Joubert, and assaults men while mutilating them, explaining why he did not harm Jessie in the house and why Gerald's ears were missing.

Jessie arrives at court as Joubert is being arraigned. He breaks free of his handcuffs and quotes what she said before leaving the house, mocking her and indicating that he was in fact there at the time. Seeing Gerald and her father in him, she tells him, ""You're so much smaller than I remember"", and leaves triumphantly.

Death Becomes Her,1992,Robert Zemeckis,M,Goldie Hawn,F,"Madeline is married to Ernest, who was once arch-rival Helen's fiance. After recovering from a mental breakdown, Helen vows to kill Madeline and steal back Ernest. Unfortunately for everyone, the introduction of a magic potion causes things to be a great deal more complicated than a mere murder plot.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Becomes_Her,"In 1978, narcissistic and fading actress Madeline Ashton performs in an awful Broadway musical called Songbird. She invites long-time frenemy, the meek aspiring writer Helen Sharp, backstage along with Helen's fiancé, famed plastic surgeon Ernest Menville. Smitten with Madeline, Ernest breaks off his engagement with Helen to marry Madeline. Seven years later, a lonely, obese, depressed, and destitute Helen is committed to a psychiatric hospital where she obsesses over taking revenge against Madeline.

Another seven years later, Madeline and Ernest live an opulent but miserable life in Beverly Hills: Madeline is depressed about her age and withering beauty and Ernest, now an alcoholic, has been reduced to working as a reconstructive mortician. After receiving an invitation to a party celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes for beauty treatments. Desperate to look younger, Madeline is given the business card of Lisle Von Rhuman, a mysterious, wealthy socialite who specializes in rejuvenation.

Madeline and Ernest attend Helen's party and discover that Helen is now slim, glamorous and youthful despite being fifty years old. Jealous of Helen's appearance, Madeline observes as Helen tells Ernest that she blames Madeline for his career decline. Madeline later visits her young lover but discovers he is with a woman of his own age. Despondent, Madeline drives to Lisle's mansion. The youthful Lisle claims to be seventy-one years old and offers Madeline a potion that promises eternal life and youth. Madeline drinks the potion which reverses her age, restoring her beauty, but Lisle warns her that she must disappear from the public eye after ten years, to avoid suspicion of her immortality, and treat her body well.

Meanwhile, Helen seduces Ernest and convinces him to kill Madeline. When Madeline returns home, she belittles Ernest who snaps and pushes her down the stairs, breaking her neck. However, she inexplicably survives and Ernest takes Madeline to the hospital where the doctor's analysis shows she is clinically dead. Ernest considers her reanimation to be a miracle and uses his skills to repair her body at home. Helen arrives and, after overhearing her and Ernest discussing their murder plot, Madeline shoots Helen with a shotgun. The blast leaves a large hole in Helen's torso but she remains alive, revealing that she also has taken Lisle's potion. Helen and Madeline fight before apologizing and reconciling. Depressed at the situation, Ernest prepares to leave, but Helen and Madeline convince him to first repair their bodies. Realizing they will need regular maintenance, they scheme to have Ernest drink the potion to ensure his permanent availability.

The pair knock out Ernest and bring him to Lisle, who offers him the potion in exchange for his surgical skills. Although tempted, Ernest rejects immortality, concerned about outliving anyone he cares about—forcing him to spend eternity with Madeline and Helen—and the physical consequences Madeline and Helen have already suffered. He flees with the potion but becomes trapped on the roof. Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion to survive an impending fall but, realizing they only want him for selfish reasons, he throws the potion away. Ernest survives the fall after landing in Lisle's pool and escapes. Lisle banishes Madeline and Helen from her group, leaving the pair in despair at the realization that they will have to depend on each other for companionship and maintenance, forever.

Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having achieved true immortality by living an adventurous and fulfilling life and having many children and grandchildren. Now grotesque parodies of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty covering most of their grey and decrepit flesh, Helen and Madeline mock the eulogy and leave.

While inspecting a dilapidated orphanage, the group discover it is still occupied by an elderly woman called Ginny. When she claims she has papers to prove she still owns the property, an argument breaks out, briefly interrupted by a silent and towering man from upstairs.

Ginny then collapses from a heart attack and is rushed to the hospital, accompanied by Ruth and the man. An investor, Catherine, along with a group of potential buyers arrive in Harlow on a large bus, distracting Melody and Dante. Meanwhile, Lila strikes up a friendship with a local mechanic, Richter, and reveals she was a survivor of a school shooting, leaving her terrified of guns. Ginny dies en route to the hospital; Ruth texts Melody before the man goes berserk and murders the officers driving the ambulance, leading it to crash.

When Ruth awakens, she witnesses the man, revealed to be Leatherface, cutting off Ginny's face to wear as a mask. Ruth manages to radio for help before being killed by Leatherface, who makes his way back to Harlow. During a property auction, Melody reads Ruth's texts and prepares to leave with Lila.

","Following the film's release, many journalists and film critics commented on its themes of gun violence and gentrification, as well as minor commentary on social media and influencers. Lex Briscuso of Paste wrote that the film is ""ultimately conservative in its messaging.""[60]

Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com interpreted the film as a cautionary tale against gentrification, as well as one plays with the concept of social media.[61] Sonny Bunch of The Bulwark wrote that the film's protagonists, Gen Z social media influencers who move to a small Texas town, can be viewed as both ""a plague of iPhone-carrying locusts"" and sympathetic within the film's context.[62] Cathy Gunning of Screen Rant also believed the film tackled the topic of gentrification, though with less subtlety than the original.[63] Elisa Guimarães of Collider wrote that the film satirizes everyone ""from influences to bankers"", and attempts to tackle the topics of ""school shootings, gun control, gentrification, historical racism, [and] cancel culture"", though the author believes it failed at doing so well. Guimarães believed much of the film's intended messaging was too vague, saying that it is unclear as to whether the film is pro-gun rights or pro-gun control, and accused the film of being ""racist"" for its scene involving several characters arguing over the presence of a Confederate flag.[64] Kimberly Myles of the Los Angeles Times noted that the film dealt with ""social commentary on school shootings, gentrification and racism"", while being unsubtle about it.[65] Sean O'Neal of Texas Monthly believed the film mocked ""opportunistic hipsters"" who move from California to Texas, while defending the local Texan rednecks, who are proven right in their suspicions. O'Neal also wrote that the film features an amusing and ""ludicrous"" scene, in which a group of party-goers record Leatherface on their phones, with one threatening to cancel him, before he proceeds to brutally murder them.[66] The scene was generally perceived as a tongue-in-cheek mockery of cancel culture.[67][68]

The film's producer, Fede Álvarez, stated in an interview with Collider that the film deals with the topics of gun violence and morality. Álvarez states that the film is intentionally vague and lacks exact clarity in its themes, as it was the filmmaker's intention to explore moral and political division:

""There's this theme, there's two sides of it. These people are wrong, these people are right,' because that's not how the world works for us. The world is a f*cking mess and [there's] shades of gray and there can be all sorts of characters in both sides of the story, so that's the way we approached it. We wanted you to walk out of it and go, 'Wait, but I still don't have an answer! Who was right and wrong?' Because that is the way that life works. I know that some movies do give you an answer and they take a strong point of view. For us, in something like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it's the most gruesome horror movie, you've gotta be chaotic and it cannot be preachy. It's not school time.""[69]

The film's director, David Blue Garcia, said in an interview with Polygon that while the film had social commentary, he did not wish for the film to make ""a statement"" on political issues, and described the film's gun politics as ""very nuanced.""","### Themes Related to Womanhood

She is not portrayed as a mother, adolescent, professional related to beauty or perfection, or a caretaker.

Inland Empire,2006,David Lynch,M,Laura Dern,F,An actress's perception of reality becomes increasingly distorted as she finds herself falling for her co-star in a remake of an unfinished Polish production that was supposedly cursed.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_Empire_(film),"In a hotel room, the Lost Girl—a young prostitute—cries following an unpleasant encounter with a client while watching a television show about a family of surrealistic anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions.

Meanwhile in Los Angeles, actress Nikki Grace auditions for the lead role in the film On High in Blue Tomorrows. In her mansion, she is visited by a neighbor who asks about the film and then tells ""an old tale"": a boy passed through the doorway into the world, causing a reflection that gave birth to an evil that followed him. Then she tells a variation: a girl was lost in the marketplace - ""as if half-born"" - while the alley behind the marketplace was the way to the palace. The woman is certain that Nikki will get the role, and insists that despite Nikki's claims to the contrary, the plot involves murder. The next day, Nikki celebrates having won the role as her Polish husband Piotrek watches on.

During the first rehearsal involving Nikki and the film's lead actor Devon, the actors are interrupted by a disturbance on the set. Devon investigates, but finds nothing. Shaken by the event, director Kingsley Stewart confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German film entitled 47, based on a Polish folk-tale. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumors of the film being cursed.

After filming the first few romantic scenes between their respective characters Sue and Billy, Nikki and Devon begin an affair, despite earlier protestations that their relationship would be strictly professional and despite Piotrek warning Devon of ""dark consequences"" for ""wrong actions"". Nikki starts to have difficulties distinguishing between real life and scenes from the film. Entering a door marked ""Axxon N."" in an alley, she finds herself walking onto the set and causing the disturbance during the first rehearsal weeks earlier. Nikki runs away and enters a prop, which turns into an actual house. Inside the house, Nikki sees her husband going to bed. She hides from him in a closet, where she encounters a troupe of prostitutes.

At this point, various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other, with the chronological order and the distinction between characters unclear. Some scenes show her joining the (modern-day) prostitutes, while other scenes depict prostitutes and pimps in a wintery Łódź in the 1930s. She is also shown to live a troubled marriage with her poor husband ""Smithy"". In another set of scenes, Nikki/Sue is talking to a policeman in a room above a nightclub. She tells him how she was sexually abused in her childhood and how her husband joined a traveling circus from Poland as a gamekeeper. She also speaks of the Phantom, a hypnotist who worked at the circus and then disappeared.

In one scene, Sue confronts Billy in front of his family, professing her love. She is sent away and slapped by Billy's wife Doris. It is now revealed that Doris was the woman who earlier told a policeman that she had been hypnotized to kill someone and found a screwdriver sticking in her own stomach. Doris remembers that the Phantom hypnotized her to kill Sue.

Feeling stalked by the Phantom, Nikki/Sue arms herself with a screwdriver. Walking down Hollywood Boulevard she notices her doppelgänger and Doris, and meets with the policeman above the nightclub. Outside, she is eventually stabbed by Doris with her own screwdriver. Nikki/Sue collapses at a bus stop next to two homeless women. One of the homeless women tells all kinds of strange stories about her friend Niko, while the other holds a lighter in front of Sue's face until she dies. Kingsley yells ""Cut!"" and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene.

Kingsley informs Nikki that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrows but events that are occurring in real-time. She follows a man upstairs and enters an apartment marked ""Axxon N"". Confronted by the Phantom, Nikki shoots him. The Phantom transforms into a grotesque figure before dying. Nikki flees into Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television - though she fails to see them - and then meets the Lost Girl. The Lost Girl escapes from the hotel and into Smithy's house, where she happily embraces her husband and son. Nikki is back at her mansion.

The film ends with a celebration involving the troupe of prostitutes, a one-legged woman mentioned earlier, Niko and her pet monkey, and others. The women dance to Nina Simone's ""Sinner Man"", while a lumberjack saws a log.

","When asked about Inland Empire, Lynch refrained from explaining the film, responding that it is ""about a woman in trouble, and it's a mystery, and that's all I want to say about it.""[15] When presenting screenings of the digital work, Lynch sometimes opened with a quotation from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad:

We are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe.[16][17]

New York Film Festival official Richard Peña summarized the film as ""a plotless collection of snippets that explore themes Lynch has been working on for years"", including ""a Hollywood story about a young actress who gets a part in a film that might be cursed; a story about the smuggling of women from Eastern Europe; and an abstract story about a family of people with rabbit heads sitting around in a living room.""[15] The Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw called the film ""a meditation on the unacknowledged and unnoticed strangeness of Hollywood and movie-making in general"", adding that Lynch ""establishes a bizarre series of worm-holes between the worlds of myth, movies and reality.""[18] Critic Mark Fisher wrote that the film ""often seems like a series of dream sequences floating free of any grounding reality, a dream without a dreamer [in which] no frame is secure"", but argued that ""it is the film that is mad, not the characters in it ... it is Hollywood itself that is dreaming"".[19] He also commented that ""to see Lynch's worlds captured on digital video makes for a bizarre short-circuiting: as if we are witnessing a direct feed from the unconscious"".[19]

Dennis Lim of Slate described the film as ""a three-hour waking nightmare that derives both its form and its content from the splintering psyche of a troubled Hollywood actress"", and commented on Lynch's use of digital video, describing it as ""the medium of home movies, viral video, and pornography—the everyday media detritus we associate more with ... intimate or private viewing experiences than communal ones"", adding that the film ""progresses with the darting, associative logic of hyperlinks"".[20] Scholar Anne Jerslev has argued that the film ""constitutes multiple and fractured modes of perception in a world of digital screens"".[21] Jerslev further contends that the film features ""formal similarities with a website's hyperlinked layering of screens/windows, constantly disclosing new worlds from new points of view"", but according to theorist Steven Shaviro ""it also builds on cinematic codes, even as it deconstructs them"".","### Themes Related to Womanhood

Black Christmas,1974,Bob Clark,M,Olivia Hussey,F,A sorority house is terrorized by a stranger who makes frightening phone calls and then murders the sorority sisters during Christmas break.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Christmas_(1974_film),"An unseen man climbs the exterior of a sorority house, where a Christmas party is being held, and enters the attic. The house phone then rings, and sorority sister Jess Bradford answers to discover it is an obscene phone call from a person who has called before, whom the sorority has nicknamed ""The Moaner"". Jess and the other sorority members listen as the caller rants and screams in strange voices, before abruptly threatening to kill them. Upset by the call, a younger student named Clare Harrison decides to leave, and goes upstairs to her bedroom to pack her suitcase. There, unbeknownst to the rest of the sorority, Clare is attacked by the killer hiding in her closet and killed.

The following morning, Clare's father arrives, saying that Clare failed to meet up with him at a train station. Housemother Mrs. MacHenry offers to help Mr. Harrison look for her. Later that day, Jess informs her boyfriend, Peter, that she is pregnant and plans to undergo an abortion, much to his disapproval. Meanwhile, Harrison and two other sorority members, Barb and Phyl, attempt to report Clare's disappearance to Sergeant Nash, who does not take them seriously at first until Chris Hayden, Clare's boyfriend, barges in angrily later in the day and demands something be done about it.

A search party is held that night for Clare, in which Harrison, Chris, and most of the sorority gets involved. Meanwhile, MacHenry discovers Clare's body in the attic before the killer murders her with a crane hook. Shortly after, Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police. Shortly after, Lieutenant Fuller arrives with a telephone lineman to tap the phone, so that the police can determine the identity of the harasser.

After Fuller leaves, a group of Christmas carolers appear at the front door. As Jess watches the singers, the killer sneaks into Barb's room and stabs her to death with a glass unicorn figurine, with her cries for help being drowned out by the carolers. Jess then receives another obscene phone call, in which the caller emulates parts of an earlier argument she had with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller calls her to say the attempt to trace the call failed, and they both begin placing suspicions towards Peter. Jess and Phyl decide to lock up every door and window in the house. Shortly after, however, Phyl is murdered by the killer after finding Barb's body.

Jess receives yet another obscene phone call, which is successfully traced by the police. Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls are coming from inside the house. Jess goes to alert Barb and Phyl, only to discover them dead. Jess sees the killer's eye staring at her through a door crack, before she slams the door against him and flees. The killer chases after her, and (unable to open the front door) Jess runs into the basement, locking it behind her. Shortly after, though, Peter breaks through the basement window and slowly approaches Jess as he worriedly asks if she is okay. In a state of panic, Jess beats Peter to death with a firepoker, and the police find her barely conscious as she cradles Peter's body.

Believing that Peter was the killer, the police put Jess to bed and leave her alone in her bedroom, with a police officer standing outside. However, the killer's voice is heard from the attic, and a shadow is seen descending the attic's ladder before the house's telephone begins to ring, implying the killer has murdered Jess.

The Night House,2020,David Bruckner,M,Rebecca Hall,F,"Reeling from the unexpected death of her husband, Beth is left alone in the lakeside home he built for her. Soon she begins to uncover her recently deceased husband's disturbing secrets.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_House,"Beth has just lost her husband Owen to suicide. Devastated, she spends her nights drinking and going through Owen's belongings. She tries to appear stable and in control, but her friend Claire and neighbour Mel are concerned for her. Owen's ominous suicide note—""You were right. There is nothing. Nothing is after you. You're safe now.""—perplexes her. She begins to suffer from strange supernatural events at night and finds a strange reversed floor plan for their house.

One night, she discovers a photo on his phone of a woman who looks similar to her, and suspects Owen was having an affair. After a night out with Claire, a drunken Beth reveals that she had been clinically dead for four minutes after a car accident years ago and saw that there was nothing when she died. Owen had always disagreed with this and was close to changing her mind before he died. Beth says that when she suffered from depression a year ago, Owen began sleepwalking, and she thought she had passed her negative emotions to him. That night, she is awakened by a supernatural presence and witnesses several frightened women fleeing through the woods and jumping into the lake. She finds blood on the boat where Owen shot himself and feels an invisible presence.

Crossing the lake to investigate a strange set of lights, she discovers a reversed copy of her house and sees ghostly figures of women with Owen. She passes out and awakens in her own house. She looks for the reversed house again and finds it, although this time it is unfinished and empty. She retrieves a strange statue from it and confronts Mel, who claims he never saw the house but once saw Owen in the woods at night with a woman who looked like Beth. Searching Owen's laptop, she finds more photos of women who look similar to her, identifies the statue from one of his books as an occult voodoo doll, and determines that Owen was trying to learn how to trick and trap demonic entities.

Beth finds the bookstore where Owen bought the books and encounters Madelyne, one of the women from Owen's photos, who denies sleeping with him. Beth visits Claire who asks her to spend a few days away from the house. She agrees and heads home to pack, where she threatens the ghost in the house. Madelyne arrives and tells Beth how Owen invited her to the reverse house. When Owen kissed her, he attempted to choke her, but apologized after she panicked and drove her back home. A drunk Beth visits the reverse house, and under the floorboards finds the bodies of the women Owen had photographed.

An invisible force caresses Beth and she hugs it, mistaking it for Owen's spirit. The spirit reveals that it is not Owen and shows her visions of Owen attacking and murdering the women. The entity drags her through the house, reveals that it is what Beth saw when she died in the car accident, and identifies itself as ""Nothing"". It explains that it tried to convince Owen to kill Beth to bring her back to the afterlife, but he resisted. Instead, Owen built the reverse house and murdered the Beth-lookalikes to try to trick Nothing, but Nothing realized the trick. It then traps Beth in a position like the statue that she had retrieved from the reverse house earlier.

In the morning, Claire arrives and sees evidence of a fight in the house. Discovering the gun Owen used to kill himself is gone, she rushes out to the dock with Mel, where they find Beth floating out in the boat with the gun. In Nothing's dimension, the entity tries to convince Beth to join it by killing herself, but Beth decides to put the gun down and not commit suicide. As soon as she moves the gun away from herself, Beth returns to the real world, where Claire is swimming toward the boat to save her. Once ashore, Beth sees the outline of the entity in the boat. Mel asks her what she is staring at and says, ""There's nothing there,"" to which Beth replies, ""I know"".",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

Escape Room,2019,Adam Robitel,M,Taylor Russell,F,"Six strangers find themselves in circumstances beyond their control, and must use their wits to survive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Room_(2019_film),"Six people from varied backgrounds are presented with a puzzle cube: Zoey, a physics student; Jason, a wealthy daytrader; Ben, a stockboy; Mike, a truck driver; Amanda, an Iraq War veteran; and Danny, an escape room enthusiast. When they solve the puzzle, they are invited to take part in an escape room with a $10,000 prize. The participants arrive at an office block with no greeting, and when Ben tries to leave, the door handle falls off, revealing that the challenge has begun. They escape the first two rooms, a giant heating oven and a winter cabin. After finding the key, however, the rooms become fatal. Danny falls through the ice in an icy room and drowns; Amanda plummets from a fatal height in an upside-down billiards bar where parts of the floor periodically fall into a deep shaft below; Jason shocks Mike to death to solve a puzzle in a hospital room filling up with poisonous gas, leaving Zoey behind to die after she refuses to leave in order to destroy security cameras; and in a room with optical illusions, strobe lights and transdermal drugs coating the surfaces, Ben kills Jason over an antidote required to escape.

Some rooms, through songs playing, coats, and hospital beds, remind the players of them being sole survivors of various disasters; Mike escaped a mine cave-in, Zoey survived a plane crash, Danny survived when his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Amanda survived an IED blast, Jason survived a shipwreck in frigid weather, and Ben survived a car accident where his friends died. Zoey realizes that the purpose of the game is to determine which player is the luckiest. Ben, after escaping the last room where a wall moves inwards to crush him, meets the Gamemaster, who controls the game that the Puzzle Maker designed. The Gamemaster explains that each year they lure in players with something in common – college athletes, savants, etc. – and wealthy viewers bet on the result, with the current game luring in sole survivors of previous disasters. The Gamemaster tries to kill Ben, but Zoey intervenes, having used an oxygen mask in the hospital room to survive until the room was unlocked by cleaning staff. Together they kill the Gamemaster.

As Ben recovers, Zoey returns to the building with a detective. The police do not believe Zoey, as all evidence of the game has disappeared. They do not believe Ben either, as he is found to have drugs in his system from a previous room. While looking at the graffiti on the wall, Zoey notices the words ""No Way Out"" and realizes they are an anagram for ""Wootan Yu"", a name that appeared in several places throughout the escape rooms, suggesting the game is not over. Six months later, Zoey meets up with Ben and shows him newspaper articles that passed off the other players' deaths as everyday accidents. When Ben suggests Zoey should move on, she refuses. She reveals clues to Ben that point to an unlisted building in Manhattan. Ben agrees to go with her. However, the Puzzle Maker is already preparing to make their flight a new deadly game of survival.

Drag Me to Hell,2009,Sam Raimi,M,Alison Lohman,F,"After denying a woman the extension she needs to keep her home, loan officer Christine Brown sees her once-promising life take a startling turn for the worse. Christine is convinced she's been cursed by a Gypsy, but her boyfriend is skeptical. Her only hope seems to lie in a psychic who claims he can help her lift the curse and keep her soul from being dragged straight to hell.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_Me_to_Hell,"In 1969 Pasadena, a Hispanic couple seek help from young medium Shaun San Dena, saying their son Juan is ill and hears evil voices after stealing a silver necklace from a Gypsy's wagon, despite his attempts to return it. San Dena prepares a séance, but an unseen force attacks them and fatally drags Juan to Hell, and he is never seen again after this. San Dena vows to fight the demon again one day.

In present-day Los Angeles, bank loan officer Christine Brown vies for a promotion to assistant branch manager with her co-worker, Stu Rubin. Her boss, Jim Jacks, advises her to demonstrate tough decision-making. Sylvia Ganush, an elderly and disheveled European Roma woman, asks for a third extension on her mortgage. However, Christine denies her request. After this, Ganush cries and begs not to have her house repossessed. Security guards arrive and she leaves, angrily accusing Christine of shaming her. In the parking lot, Ganush ambushes and violently attacks Christine. After a long struggle, Ganush rips a button from Christine's coat and curses it. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton visit fortune teller Rham Jas, who tells Christine a dark spirit is haunting her. At home, the entity begins to violently attack Christine. At work, she hallucinates about Ganush and bleeds profusely from her nose while spewing blood on Jacks. As Christine leaves, Stu steals a file that is on her desk.

Christine decides to go beg Ganush for forgiveness, but she discovers that she has recently died. After causing a scene at her funeral, a family member of Ganush warns her that she deserves everything that she is about to get. Christine returns to Jas, who explains that as long as she owns the cursed button, a powerful demon known as the Lamia will torment her for three days before literally dragging her to Hell. However, he suggests that a sacrifice may appease it. Christine reluctantly decides to sacrifice her pet kitten before meeting Clay's parents at their house for dinner, during which grotesque hallucinations torment her again, such as seeing the Gypsy’s eye in her slice of harvest cake.

Christine returns to Jas, and he requests a fee of $10,000. He introduces her to San Dena, who prepares a séance to trap Lamia in a goat and kill it. However, the Lamia possesses her and then her assistant, who vomits up the corpse of Christine's cat, saying it wants her soul. San Dena manages to successfully banish the Lamia from the séance, but dies afterwards. Jas seals the button in an envelope and tells Christine that she can only remove the curse by giving the button to someone else. She attempts to give the envelope at a diner: to a tearful Stu (whom she tries to blackmail into accepting it) and to an ailing, married elderly woman; bothered by her conscience, she doesn’t do either. Instead, she decides to dig up Ganush's grave and shoves the envelope into her mouth at dawn. Christine returns home and prepares to meet Clay at Los Angeles Union Station for a weekend trip. Jacks notifies her of the promotion after Stu confessed to stealing her file and was fired.

At the station, Clay, who is hoping to propose to Christine, hands her the envelope with her missing button he found in his car, unaware of its significance. She realizes that she accidentally gave the wrong envelope to Ganush, which means that because of this, the curse was never lifted. Horrified, Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks. An oncoming train is about to kill her when the ground beneath her starts to glow and fiery, demonic hands drag her down. The train speeds through while Clay helplessly looks on as the demonic hands fatally drag her to Hell, ending the film.

","Drag Me to Hell has been noted for its relevance to the subprime mortgage crisis, and, more broadly, the Great Recession, which were ongoing at the time of the film's release.[4][5][6] Director Sam Raimi reportedly considered this a coincidence, stating, ""We just wanted to tell the story of a person who wants to be a good person but who makes a sinful choice out of greed, for their own benefit, and pays the price for it.""[4]

Additionally, shortly after its release, a fan theory garnered attention online, positing that Christine—who is depicted as having been overweight in her youth—is experiencing hallucinations as a result of an eating disorder rather than a supernatural curse, with her delusions repeatedly involving food or vomiting.","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

India's great aunt Gwendolyn visits the family, to Evelyn and Charlie's dismay. Gwendolyn shows surprise at Charlie's claims of traveling the world and tells Evelyn that she needs to talk to her about Charlie. Gwendolyn changes hotels due to an unexplained fear and suspicion of Charlie. She loses her cell phone and tries to call the Stokers' home from a phone booth, but Charlie arrives and strangles her to death with his belt. Meanwhile, India discovers Mrs. McGarrick's body in the freezer and realizes Charlie is a murderer.

India unleashes her inner aggression at school and stabs a bully, Chris Pitts, in the hand with a pencil after he tries to land a punch to her head. This draws the attention of another classmate, Whip Taylor. At home, India witnesses Evelyn and Charlie growing intimate. She wanders off to a local diner where she runs into Whip. She and Whip go into the woods, where they proceed to make out, until India aggressively bites his lip. Whip attempts to rape India before Charlie intervenes and breaks Whip's neck with his belt while Whip's body lies on top of India. India aids Charlie in burying the body in her garden. She attempts to call Gwendolyn, but hears her phone ring in the garden, realizing Charlie killed her too. While showering, India masturbates to the memory of the murder, climaxing as she remembers Charlie breaking Whip's neck.

While going through Richard's office to gather things of his she wants to keep, India discovers that a key she received as a birthday present belongs to a locked drawer to Richard's desk. Inside, she finds dozens of letters Charlie wrote to her over the years, which detail his travels and his love for his niece, although they have never met. However, she sees that the sending address is a mental institution. She confronts Charlie, who explains the truth: Charlie killed his and Richard's younger brother Jonathan as a child by burying him alive in a sandbox because he was jealous that Richard paid more attention to him. He was then put in a mental institution. When released on India's 18th birthday, Richard gave Charlie a car, money, and an apartment in New York City on the condition that he stay away from Richard's family. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Charlie bludgeoned Richard to death with a rock and staged the car accident.

India is shocked and angered, but Charlie explains he has come for her and gives her a birthday present, a pair of stiletto heels, to replace her more childish saddle shoes. She seemingly forgives Charlie and grows closer to him after he provides an alibi for her when Sheriff Howard questions her about Whip's disappearance. They grow close to intimate before Evelyn witnesses them. Charlie tells India that, after waiting until she came of age, he wants her to come to New York with him. Later, Evelyn coldly expresses her desire to watch India suffer before confronting Charlie, implying that she knows the truth about Richard's death and Charlie's institutionalization. Charlie seduces Evelyn and then attempts to strangle her with a belt, but India fatally shoots him in the neck with her rifle. She buries Charlie's body in the backyard, then leaves for New York in his car.

India is pulled over for speeding by Sheriff Howard, who asks her why she's in a hurry. She replies that she wanted to catch his attention, then stabs him in the neck with a pair of pruning shears. She pursues the bleeding sheriff into a field to shoot him with her rifle.

","In addition to screenwriter Wentworth Miller stating that the film was influenced by Shadow of a Doubt, there are a number of Hitchcock's themes, plot devices and motifs used within it. Both Matthew Goode's character and Joseph Cotten's character in Shadow of a Doubt share the name ""Uncle Charlie"", as well as Hitchcock's use of the likeable criminal. The complex relationship that develops between Uncle Charlie and India alludes to Hitchcock's use of the double, with the young Charlie and Uncle Charlie in Shadow of a Doubt. Many of Uncle Charlie and India's key interactions occur on a staircase, which is a Hitchcock motif also used in Shadow of a Doubt. There is a pivotal scene in Stoker that takes place near a train track and the rumbling train makes an aural intrusion, which plays into Hitchcock's use of trains as a sexual euphemism.","### Analysis of ""Stoker""

House of Wax,2005,Jaume Collet-Serra,M,Elisha Cuthbert,F,A group of unwitting teens are stranded near a strange wax museum and soon must fight to survive and keep from becoming the next exhibit.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wax_(2005_film),"En route to a football game, Carly Jones, her troubled brother Nick, her boyfriend Wade Felton and their friends— Dalton Chapman, Paige Edwards and Blake Johnson— set up camp for the night in a wooded area. A stranger in a pickup truck arrives, then leaves after Nick smashes one of his headlights. The next day, Wade discovers his car's fan belt has been severed; a local named Lester offers to drive Wade and Carly to the nearby town of Ambrose while the rest of the group head to the game.

In Ambrose, which is virtually a ghost town, Carly and Wade meet Bo Sinclair, a mechanic who offers to sell them a fan belt and drive them back to their car after he finishes attending a funeral. While waiting, they visit ""Trudy's House of Wax"", a wax museum-like tourist trap which itself and everything in it is made out of wax and is the central feature of the town. They eventually follow Bo back to his house to get the fan belt; Carly waits in his truck while Wade goes inside to use the bathroom. Wade is knocked unconscious by Bo's twin brother, Vincent, who wears a wax mask to cover the facial disfigurement he has from where they were once conjoined. When Carly notices Bo's truck has a broken headlight and realizes he was the one who visited the campsite, she flees from the scene, chased by Bo who catches her and takes her down to the gas station cellar. Meanwhile, Vincent covers Wade's body in molten wax.

Realizing they will not arrive at the game in time, the rest of the group return to Ambrose's outskirts, whereupon Nick and Dalton begin searching the town to look for Carly and Wade. When Carly attempts to call for help, Bo cuts off the tip of her index finger. She finally alerts Nick, who fends off Bo and frees Carly, while Dalton finds Wade as part of the House of Wax, restrained in his wax coating. Dalton tries to free Wade by peeling off the wax from his face, inadvertently removing his skin in the process. Vincent then ambushes Dalton and slashes off a section of Wade's face, causing him to die of shock, before dispatching Dalton.

While searching the town for help, the Joneses realize that wax figures that were created, both in the House of Wax and placed around Ambrose to make it appear populated, are actually the wax-coated corpses of its inhabitants and visitors lured there: Vincent had been attempting to continue the wax sculpting work of his and Bo's mother and the House of Wax's creator and namesake, Trudy Sinclair, after her death, but Bo began manipulating Vincent into making more realistic figures out of their victims. Back at the town's outskirts, Vincent murders Blake and chases Paige into an abandoned sugar mill, where he does the same to her by throwing a metal pipe into her forehead. Vincent later encounters the Joneses in the House of Wax's basement, during which Nick unintentionally starts a fire, causing a building-wide inferno. Intercepted by Bo upstairs, Nick battles him, only to be stabbed in the leg before being saved by Carly, who beats Bo to death with a baseball bat. Furious over his brother's murder, Vincent chases Carly to the top floor where she tries to reason with him about Bo's manipulation but, with Nick's help, then stabs him in the back. The deceased Vincent falls through the floor and lands on top of Bo's corpse, while the Joneses escape as the House of Wax melts to the ground.

The next morning, local authorities, having been drawn to Ambrose by the fire's smoke, arrive and report about how the town had been abandoned for a decade since the sugar mill went out of business. As the Joneses are driven away in an ambulance, one of the officers is told that the Sinclair family did not have just two sons, but three. The ambulance containing the Joneses passes by Lester, who is implied to be the third son and waves the siblings goodbye while smiling.

Orphan: First Kill,2022,William Brent Bell,M,Isabelle Fuhrman,F,"After escaping from an Estonian psychiatric facility, Leena Klammer travels to America by impersonating Esther, the missing daughter of a wealthy family. But when her mask starts to slip, she is put against a mother who will protect her family from the murderous “child” at any cost.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphan:_First_Kill,"In January 2007, Estonian psychiatric patient Leena Klammer, a 31-year-old woman with a rare hormonal disorder called hypopituitarism that gives her the appearance of a 9-year-old child, orchestrates an escape from the Saarne Institute by seducing and killing a guard and hiding in the car of an art therapist named Anna. After breaking into Anna's house and killing her, Leena looks up missing American girls and finds that she bears a striking resemblance to Esther Albright, a girl from a rich family who went missing in 2003. Later, posing as a lost girl, Leena is approached by a Russian police officer and introduces herself as ""Esther,” claiming that her parents are in the United States.

In Darien, Connecticut, wealthy artist Allen Albright and his wife Tricia, who has since come to terms with the disappearance of their daughter, are informed by Detective Donnan that ""Esther"" has been found. Tricia travels to the U.S. embassy in Moscow where she is ""reunited"" with Esther. Tricia brings Esther home and immediately starts to have doubts when she notices that Esther has forgotten about the death of her grandmother or that her painting skills have increased enormously compared to before she disappeared. Leena falls in love with Allen after they both start bonding over their painting skills, and tries to separate him from Tricia.

While Tricia and Allen attend a charity gala hosted by Tricia, Donnan arrives at the house and steals a vinyl record from Esther's room which has Leena's fingerprints on it. He takes it back to his house, unaware that Leena has followed him, and analyzes the fingerprints to find it is not a match. Leena attacks Donnan and stabs him with a knife repeatedly, before Tricia arrives, having followed Leena. Instead of stopping Leena, Tricia opens fire on Donnan with a gun and kills him. Tricia reveals that she knows Leena is not Esther, who died four years earlier during an altercation with her older brother Gunnar, which Tricia covered up without Allen's knowledge. Tricia explains that she is only welcoming Leena to make Allen happy again and that if she refuses to cooperate, she would report her to the authorities for ""murdering"" Donnan. Leena reveals her true identity to Tricia, and the two then dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch where the real Esther is buried and frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.

Tricia eventually terminates the deal but realizing that it would be too suspicious if ""Esther"" were to disappear again, Tricia and Gunnar pretend that Leena is still ""Esther"" in Allen's presence. Later, Tricia tries to poison Leena during dinner: Leena feeds the meal to a rat living in her room and finds it dead the next morning. She retaliates by making a smoothie containing the rat's carcass for Tricia. She also attempts to push Tricia and Gunnar in front of a train, but is stopped by an incoming passenger. With Allen away at an art gallery exhibition, Leena tries fleeing by stealing Tricia's car, but she is soon found by a police officer.

That night, Leena is brought back to the Albright house and Tricia and Gunnar finally decide to kill Leena for good. Tricia tries to stage a suicide, but Leena fights back and flees before Gunnar throws her down the stairs. Distracted by a phone call from Allen, who is returning home, Tricia and Gunnar search for Leena when she disappears. Gunnar eventually finds Leena in the art room but Leena shoots Gunnar with a crossbow and then stabs him to death with his fencing sword. An enraged Tricia and Leena fight in the kitchen, inadvertently setting the house alight in the process, and the pair flee to the roof as Allen returns home.

Tricia and Leena both slip and end up clinging to the roof, begging Allen to save them, with Leena claiming Tricia attacked her, and Tricia trying to reveal the truth about Leena. Unable to save both of them, Allen chooses to help ""Esther"", causing Tricia to lose her grip and fall to her death. Allen then checks Leena's face, which causes her fake teeth to fall out. Realizing she is not Esther, Leena tries to defend herself by saying she did it for them and also confesses her love for him. Allen calls her a monster, causing an enraged Leena to accidentally push him off the roof. Leena then again dresses herself as Esther and leaves the burning house after cleaning off the blood on her face.

Later, ""Esther"" is moved to an orphanage where she waits for a new family to adopt her.

The New Mutants,2020,Josh Boone,M,Blu Hunt,F,"Five young mutants, just discovering their abilities while held in a secret facility against their will, fight to escape their past sins and save themselves.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Mutants_(film),"Danielle ""Dani"" Moonstar, a young Cheyenne Native American, is hidden in a tree by her father as her entire reservation is devastated by a tornado, leaving her the only survivor. After falling unconscious, Dani awakens in an oddly empty hospital run by Dr. Cecilia Reyes, who comforts Dani, explaining that she is not an ordinary human being but, rather, has unique mutant DNA, and she advises her to remain in the hospital until she learns the effects and how to control them.

Dani is introduced to four other teenagers; Samuel ""Sam"" Guthrie, Illyana Rasputin, Roberto ""Bobby"" da Costa and Rahne Sinclair. Reyes has brought each of them to the hospital, after they have each either experienced, or accidentally caused, a horrible tragedy. Sam collapsed an entire coal mine on his father and coworkers, killing them all, Roberto accidentally burned his girlfriend to death, Rahne escaped her devoutly Catholic village by killing the priest after he branded her as a witch, and Illyana was enslaved and sexually abused as a child. All of them also possess superhuman abilities due to mutations in their DNA; Roberto can manipulate solar energy, Sam can fly at jet speed, Illyana has inter-dimensional sorcery powers, and Rahne can turn into a wolf or wolf-human hybrid along with having enhanced senses. Reyes herself is also a powerful mutant who can manipulate ""plasma-energy"" force fields.

During her first day, where Illyana implies there is nothing stopping her, Dani attempts to escape, but is stopped by a force field created by Reyes surrounding the entire hospital grounds. Further frustrated from Illyana's harshness, being stirred by the grief of losing her family, she plans to commit suicide from the church clock-tower, but is prevented by Rahne, earning a friend in Dani. The two begin to form a romantic relationship, but Illyana antagonizes Dani, who discovers that Illyana has a hand puppet of a purple dragon called Lockheed. Collectively, the five teenagers believe they are being trained to join the X-Men, hence the strict supervision. Reyes warns them that they are considered dangerous and should not leave until they have mastered their superhuman abilities. Soon, the group all begin to have horrifyingly real visions of their past tragedies, one of which results in Rahne getting branded on the neck by the same Priest whom she had previously killed. During this, Dani undergoes a neural test, inadvertently discovering Reyes's true intentions. Both Illyana and Reyes deduce that the visions are the result of Dani's powers manifesting themselves: the ability to physically manifest the greatest fears and darkest secrets from a person's mind into reality as tangible illusions. Reyes consults her employers, the Essex Corporation, who instruct her to collect Dani's DNA and then terminate her.

As Reyes straps her to a gurney, Dani's panic causes her powers to go haywire. Illyana and Sam are attacked by physical manifestations of Illyana's childhood abusers - monstrous humanoid creatures called the ""Smiling Men"" - while Roberto, who was attacked by one of the Smiling Men, tries in vain to break through the hospital's outer barrier, which has now contracted in diameter. Rahne, who was suspicious of Reyes's next ""procedure"", arrives in half-wolf form and mauls Reyes, forcing her to flee. The five regroup in Reyes's office and realize that Reyes was training them to be assassins for Essex and that, to escape, they must kill Reyes to deprive the force fields of their power source. They find and confront Reyes, who warns them that Dani is too powerful and will destroy them all due to the lack of control over her power.

Reyes restricts them all with force fields and tries to again kill Dani by asphyxiating her with a force field, which unleashes the Demon Bear – Dani's own fears manifested through her power, and the true cause of her reservation's destruction – on her; Reyes is devoured and Dani is rendered unconscious. Rahne tries to reach through to Dani's subconscious and urges her to wake up, while Illyana uses her powers to travel to her ""special place"" where she retrieves a glowing sword, armor and a tiny, physical manifestation of Lockheed to battle the Demon Bear. Eventually, Sam and Roberto join the fight, as well as Rahne, all to no avail. Dani is visited by her father's spirit, who encourages her to face her fear; she awakens and confronts the bear, calming and thus dissipating it.

Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,2019,André Øvredal,M,Zoe Colletti,F,"Mill Valley, Pennsylvania, Halloween night, 1968. After playing a joke on a school bully, Sarah and her friends decide to sneak into a supposedly haunted house that once belonged to the powerful Bellows family, unleashing dark forces that they will be unable to control.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark_(film),"On Halloween Night in 1968, in the fictional Pennsylvania town of Mill Valley, teenagers Stella, Auggie, and Chuck decide to visit the supposedly haunted home of the wealthy Bellows family. Inside a secret room, they find a book of horror stories written by Sarah Bellows, the family's teenage daughter, who was accused of witchcraft when the town's children mysteriously began to die. She allegedly committed suicide in 1898 by hanging. Tommy locks the group inside Sarah's room along with Ruth, Chuck's sister. After Tommy leaves, the lock is mysteriously opened, and Stella takes Sarah's storybook home.

Back home, Stella discovers that a new story called ""Harold"" has appeared on a previously blank page of Sarah's storybook. In a nearby cornfield, an inebriated Tommy is stalked by the titular Harold—his family's scarecrow—after it comes to life. He notices that Harold continuously moves towards his location. Harold starts walking towards him and Tommy runs away. When Tommy runs into Harold, the creature stabs him in the back with a pitchfork, causing Tommy to vomit hay and undergo a violent transformation. The next day, Tommy is reported missing, and Stella and her friend Ramón find Harold dressed in Tommy's clothes.

A new story called ""The Big Toe"" appears in Sarah's storybook. Auggie, the protagonist of the story, is kidnapped by a corpse searching for its missing toe, which is inside a stew that Auggie unknowingly eats. Auggie is then dragged under his bed by the corpse and disappears. After the remaining friends vainly attempt to destroy the storybook, they research Sarah's life. Another new story called ""The Red Spot"" is magically written. Ruth is sitting in the backstage room, getting her makeup ready for the play, and starts poking at a swollen spider bite on her cheek, which explodes and releases hundreds of tiny spiders. Ruth is rescued but is traumatized. The group's investigation takes them to the elderly Lou-Lou Baptiste, who was once a child servant of the Bellows family, and they learn that Sarah did not die in the Bellows' house like many believed. Instead, she hanged herself in the hospital where her older brother, Dr. Ephraim Bellows, was her supervising doctor.

They head to the local hospital, where they discover archived wax cylinder recordings that reveal Sarah's brother had ruthlessly performed electroshock therapy on her as part of a cover-up to get her to confess to killing the children. The family's mill had knowingly been poisoning the town's water with mercury from the paper manufacturing, leading to the deaths of the town's children.To avoid drawing legitimate suspicion to their family business, the Bellows blamed Sarah for killing the children with witchcraft. Chuck, while trying to evade hospital security, accidentally triggers an alarm which floods the hallways in the same red light from his nightmares. In the recording, Sarah begins to narrate a new story called ""The Red Room"", with Chuck as the main character. Chuck is then attacked and cornered by the Pale Lady, a phantom from his nightmares, who absorbs him.

Stella and Ramón are arrested for trespassing by Police Chief Turner, who reveals that Ramón is a Vietnam War draft dodger. Ramón reveals that it was out of fear after his brother enlisted and his dead body was returned to them in pieces. A head falls down the chimney and more body parts follow. Ramón realizes that the next creature is called the Jangly Man, a monster from a story called ""Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"" that frightened him as a child. The Jangly Man attacks Turner and snaps his neck while Ramón and Stella escape and run to the Bellows' house for answers. Stella is taken back in time while Ramón tries to evade the Jangly Man. Living out Sarah's experience of the torture, Stella promises Sarah that she will tell the truth of her innocence if she stops harming people. Stella writes down the true story with her blood, and Sarah and all of her monsters vanish.

Stella writes the truth about Sarah's life in the papers, keeping her promise. Ramón accepts his enlistment and shares an emotional goodbye with Stella before he leaves for the war. With Ruth recovered, Stella states that she will find a way to rescue Chuck and Auggie.

Ginger Snaps,2000,John Fawcett,M,Katharine Isabelle,F,"The story of two outcast sisters, Ginger and Brigitte, in the mindless suburban town of Bailey Downs. On the night of Ginger's first period, she is savagely attacked by a wild creature. Ginger's wounds miraculously heal but something is not quite right. Now Brigitte must save her sister and save herself.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Snaps_(film),"In Bailey Downs, a rash of dog killings has been occurring. Brigitte and Ginger Fitzgerald are teenage sisters who harbor a fascination with death, and as children, formed a pact to move out of the suburb or die together by the age of 16. One night, while on the way to kidnap a dog owned by school bully Trina Sinclair, Ginger begins her first period. The scent of blood results in the girls being attacked by the creature responsible for the maulings. The creature bites Ginger. As the girls flee, the creature is run over by a van belonging to Sam Miller, a local drug dealer.

Following the attack, Ginger undergoes transformations that concern Brigitte. Her wounds heal quickly, and she starts to behave aggressively, grow hair from her scars, sprout a tail, and menstruate heavily. She begins dating her classmate Jason McCardy. One night, Ginger bites Jason's neck and has unprotected sex with him, despite his insistence to use protection. Later, she furiously beats Trina in public, and kills a neighbor's dog. Brigitte seeks out Sam to obtain information on what his van struck, and they agree that Ginger was attacked by a werewolf and is transforming into one. Sam suggests infusing an extract of monkshood, also known as wolfsbane, a perennial plant often referred to in lycanthrope folklore.

Trina accuses Ginger of kidnapping her dog. She fights with Ginger and is accidentally killed. The sisters hide the body in a freezer. Brigitte accidentally breaks off two of Trina's fingers, and the fingers are misplaced. On Halloween, Brigitte brings monkshood to Sam and he creates an extract of the herb. Brigitte is attacked by Jason (who was infected by Ginger when they had sex), and defends herself by using the monkshood syringe on him. She witnesses his immediate change in behavior, which proves it is a cure. At school, she discovers Ginger's murder of a faculty member and witnesses her killing another. Ginger discloses her intent to target Sam next at the Greenhouse Bash, a Halloween party hosted by him.

The girls' mother finds the fingers and Trina's corpse. She drives Brigitte to the Greenhouse Bash, saying that she will protect them. Brigitte arrives to find Ginger hurting Sam for rejecting her sexual advances. Brigitte wounds Ginger's and her own palm and clasps their hands together, infecting herself with Ginger's blood. She convinces Ginger of her loyalty and willingness to help her. As the sisters leave, Brigitte decides to abandon her mother. Ginger feels her transformation approaching and Sam knocks her unconscious with a shovel. They take Ginger back to the Fitzgerald house to prepare more of the cure for her.

Ginger transforms into a werewolf on the way home and escapes the van. Sam and Brigitte hide in the pantry as Sam makes the cure. When he goes to find Ginger, a transformed Ginger attacks him. After finding Sam, injured and bloody, Brigitte tries to save him by drinking his blood to calm Ginger, but is unable to go through with it. Ginger senses Brigitte's insincerity, and kills Sam.

As Ginger chases Brigitte, Brigitte returns to the room where they grew up. Brigitte defends herself while holding the syringe in one hand and a knife in the other. Ginger lunges at Brigitte and into the knife, fatally wounding herself. Brigitte lays her head upon her dying sister's chest and weeps.

",,"Based on the given plot of ""Ginger Snaps"" and considering the provided categories, here are the requested analyses:

### Themes Related to Womanhood:
**1) Female Sexuality (such as coming of age):**
The transformation of Ginger into a werewolf begins with her first period, symbolizing the onset of puberty. Her subsequent changes in behavior and physical transformation can be seen as a metaphor for the tumultuous period of adolescence and the awakening of female sexuality.

**2) Other (Lycanthropy as Transformation):**
Ginger's transformation into a werewolf represents a broader theme of transformation and loss of control, reflecting inner fears and anxieties about personal changes. This aligns with themes of lycanthropy symbolizing uncontrollable and terrifying personal change.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
**1) Adolescent girl:**
Both Ginger and Brigitte are teenage sisters who are navigating the complexities of adolescence. Their roles primarily revolve around their experiences as young girls confronting extraordinary changes and threats.

### Portrayal of the Main Protagonist as a Monster:
**1) Monstrous feminine (possessed body):**
Ginger’s transformation into a werewolf and her ensuing aggressive and uncontrollable behavior fits within the concept of the ""possessed body"" or monstrous transformation. This aligns with Barbara Creed's notion of the Monstrous-Feminine, where the female reproductive body is a source of horror.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist at the End:
**1) Dies:**
Ginger dies at the end of the movie after being fatally wounded by her sister Brigitte, who inadvertently kills her while trying to defend herself.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
**1) Victimization:**
The movie primarily focuses on the victimization of both Ginger and Brigitte. Ginger becomes a victim of her uncontrollable transformation, leading her to act out violently and ultimately die. Brigitte, while trying to help her sister, is constantly in survival mode and unable to gain full agency or autonomy. The narrative centers more on their immediate survival and the horrors they face rather than on empowerment.

Thus, ""Ginger Snaps"" presents a nuanced exploration of female adolescence through the lens of horror, with primary themes of female sexuality and transformation, portraying its protagonists in adolescent roles and emphasizing victimization over empowerment.",3,2,1,1,1,1
Silent Hill,2006,Christophe Gans,M,Radha Mitchell,F,"In search for answers, a mother travels to the enigmatic town of Silent Hill when her daughter begins to suffer recurring nightmares related to the place. It doesn't take long for her to discover its home to beings as equally haunting as the town itself.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill_(film),"Rose Da Silva and her husband Christopher are disturbed by their adopted daughter Sharon's constant sleepwalking and nightmares about Silent Hill, a town in West Virginia that was abandoned in the 1970s due to a massive coal seam fire. Desperate for a solution, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behavior concerns police officer Cybil Bennett when they encounter her at a gas station en route. As they enter Silent Hill, a girl steps out into the road, causing Rose to crash and black out. She awakens in the fog-shrouded dimension of Silent Hill, and realizes that Sharon is missing.

Searching the town for Sharon, Rose pursues the girl she encountered prior to the crash, who resembles Sharon. At various points, the town suddenly transitions into a nightmarish world inhabited by inhuman monsters, including the fearsome Pyramid Head. Cybil encounters and tries to arrest Rose, but while attempting to bring her to the local station, they realize they are trapped, all roads out of town ending in a mysterious cliff. Rose encounters many other inhuman creatures and learns of Alessa Gillespie, a young girl burned as a witch by the Brethren, the town's fanatical Manichean cult. Her mother Dahlia wanders the streets as an outcast, guilt-ridden over her negligence that led to Alessa's suffering. In the real world, Christopher searches the abandoned town with policeman Thomas Gucci, but they find nothing: the town appears to them simply as a dilapidated, abandoned place devoid of fog or creatures. Gucci later reveals he lived in Silent Hill and saved Alessa from the fire. He encourages Christopher to end his futile search.

In the Silent Hill dimension, Rose encounters the girl again, revealed to be an aspect of Alessa. When the town transitions into the dark dimension, Rose, Cybil, and Anna, a Brethren member, flee to an old church, but Pyramid Head catches and flays Anna alive. Brethren members lead Rose and Cybil to a hospital, claiming the demon that has taken Sharon is in the basement. Upon noticing an image of Sharon in Rose's locket, Christabella, the high priestess of the Brethren, identifies Sharon as a likeness of Alessa. She decries the two women as witches and orders her Brethren to stop them. Cybil holds them off while Rose descends into the basement, but is quickly subdued and captured.

Rose explores the basement but is barricaded by a group of disfigured nurses. She sneaks past them and enters Alessa's room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Alessa was stigmatized by the townspeople for being born out of wedlock. Christabella convinced Dahlia to ""purify"" Alessa after Alessa was raped by the school janitor. Christabella immolated Alessa during a ritual in 1974, but Dahlia alerted Gucci. The pair arrived too late, and the ritual went awry, igniting the coal seam fire. Hospitalized and in excruciating pain, Alessa's rage split her soul apart, one half manifesting as the dark entity responsible for the shifting dimensions of Silent Hill. Her remaining innocence manifested as Sharon, who was taken to the real world to be adopted. Desperate to find Sharon, Rose allows Dark Alessa's spirit into her body, allowing it access to the church. Sharon, despite being protected by Dahlia, is captured by the Brethren.

In the church, Christabella burns Cybil as a witch and plans to do the same to Sharon. Rose confronts Christabella, denouncing her as a murderer before Christabella stabs Rose in the heart. Alessa emerges from the blood flowing from the wound as a disfigured being bound to a hospital bed, and tears Christabella and her followers apart with razor wire. Rose rescues Sharon, and Sharon and Alessa/Dark Alessa reunite into one body. Rose and Alessa leave the town and return home. Upon arriving, they discover they are still in the foggy dimension, separated from reality. Meanwhile, Christopher awakens alone in the real world and discovers that the front door has mysteriously opened.

",,"### Silent Hill Analysis:

**Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth):** Rose’s actions are driven by her maternal instinct to protect and find her adopted daughter, Sharon.
2. **Gender based violence (such as sexual or physical assault or abuse):** The backstory of Alessa involves her being raped by the school janitor and later burned by the town's cultists, both acts of gender-based violence.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
1. **Mother or housewife:** The main protagonist, Rose Da Silva, is depicted primarily in her role as a mother trying to rescue her daughter, Sharon.

**Portrayal as a Monster in the Story:**
1. **Monstrous feminine:** Alessa represents several aspects of the Monstrous-Feminine. She embodies both the ""monstrous womb"" (due to her intense rage and pain) and the ""witch"" (as indicated by the townspeople’s persecution).

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?**
1. **Survives:** Rose survives the events within the Silent Hill dimension.

**Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:**
1. **Victimization:** Although Rose takes active steps to find her daughter and confront the dangers in Silent Hill, the story ultimately revolves around her immediate survival and dealing with various psychological and physical threats. The narrative doesn't provide her with much agency beyond immediate actions to survive or protect her child. Alessa, on the other hand, exacts revenge which can be seen as empowerment, but her character is more of an avenging presence than a protagonist gaining autonomy through the narrative.

In conclusion, **""Silent Hill""** incorporates themes of motherhood and gender-based violence and portrays its main character, Rose, as a mother. The portrayal of monstrous feminine is evident through Alessa's character. Though Rose survives, the story focuses more on female victimization rather than empowerment.",1,1,1,1,2,1
We're All Going to the World's Fair,2021,Jane Schoenbrun,F,Anna Cobb,F,"Reality and fantasy begin to blur when teenager Casey, alone in her attic bedroom, immerses herself in a role-playing horror game online.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We%27re_All_Going_to_the_World%27s_Fair,"Casey, a lonely teenage girl living with her single father, records herself taking the viral ""World's Fair Challenge"". She states ""I want to go to the World's Fair"" three times, pricks her finger, smears her blood on her laptop computer screen, and watches a strobe light video, before saying she will post updates if she starts to notice any ""changes"" and posts the video publicly.

Other World's Fair challengers record and post their own psychological and physical changes and engage with viewers. In a video, Casey recounts bouts of sleepwalking she experienced when she was younger and says she has begun feeling similarly since taking the challenge. Late one night, she sneaks into her shed and finds her father's shotgun. She watches an ASMR video of a young woman calming someone after a nightmare before a video made to her from user ""JLB"" plays, featuring Casey's distorted face along with the messages ""YOU ARE IN TROUBLE"" and ""I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.""

Casey reaches out to JLB, a collaborator with other World's Fair challengers, and speaks with him over Skype, though he keeps his camera off. JLB claims to worry about the symptoms she has reported, and encourages her to keep making videos so he can monitor her wellbeing. JLB is revealed to be an equally lonely middle-aged man who spends his time watching many people's World's Fair videos.

JLB watches a video Casey recorded of herself sleeping, during which she pulls herself out of bed with a menacing smile. JLB informs her that the forces behind the World's Fair are taking her over, and that she should continue posting. The content of Casey's videos becomes increasingly disturbing: she inexplicably screams in terror while recording herself singing and dancing, she states her intention to use her father's gun to kill either him or herself, and she ominously states she will one day ""disappear"" and nobody will ever figure out what has happened to her.

In her next video, she covers her face and arms in toothpaste which glow in her blacklit bedroom and tears apart the stuffed animal she has slept with since she was a newborn. She then appears to snap out of it and tearfully expresses regret over the ruined toy. In her next conversation with JLB, she discusses strange loop theory and her sense that the world has always been false. JLB says they need to ""go out of game"" so he can ask a serious question, surprising Casey. He admits he is worried about her and says he has considered calling the police to do a wellness check on her. Casey angrily asserts that her videos were not real, she was only playing along with the challenge, and Casey is not even her real name. She cuts off contact with him and calls him a pedophile, and he tries in vain to convince her to continue making videos.

Some time later, JLB recounts having been contacted by Casey a year after their previous exchange. She apologized and said she had spent time in an assisted care facility. They exchanged real names and eventually met up in New York City, where she was participating in a theater program. Casey claimed that on the night she cut contact with JLB, she was transported to the World's Fair, but something pulled her back. JLB told her he had spent all night at the computer praying for her. JLB claims they hugged and parted ways.",,"### Themes

Ring,1998,Hideo Nakata,M,Nanako Matsushima,F,"A mysterious video has been linked to a number of deaths, and when an inquisitive journalist finds the tape and views it herself, she sets in motion a chain of events that puts her own life in danger.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(film),"During a sleepover, high schoolers Tomoko and Masami discuss an urban legend about a video tape that curses its viewers to die in 7 days after a foreboding phone call. Tomoko then confesses that last week, she and her friends watched a strange videotape and received an inexplicable phone call afterward. They receive a false alarm phone call, and then Masami goes to the toilet. Tomoko witnesses the TV turn on by itself and is killed by an unseen presence.

Reiko Asakawa, Tomoko's aunt and a journalist investigating this urban legend, attends her funeral and learns that three of Tomoko's friends, who watched the tape with her, all died at the same time she did. Reiko finds an unmarked videotape in the resort cabin where the four stayed. It contains brief, seemingly unrelated scenes accompanied by screeching sounds, and ends with a shot of a well. After watching, Reiko sees an apparition and receives a phone call emitting the screeching sounds from the tape. Convinced she has been cursed, Reiko takes the tape and leaves the cabin.

Reiko enlists the help of her psychic ex-husband Ryūji Takayama. Examining a copy of the tape that Reiko made, the pair find a cryptic message spoken in an Ōshima dialect and prepare to go to Ōshima. Before departing, Reiko catches Yōichi, her son with Ryūji, watching the tape after being urged by ""Tomoko"".

In Ōshima, Reiko and Ryūji learn about Shizuko Yamamura, the woman in the tape. Before her suicide, Shizuko gained notoriety following a public demonstration of her psychic ability organized by ESP researcher Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, with whom she had an affair. When confronting Shizuko's brother Takashi, the pair learn through a vision that during the demonstration, Shizuko's young daughter Sadako, whose name is hinted in the tape, psychically killed a journalist who decried Shizuko's abilities. After failing to track down Sadako, Reiko realizes that Ryūji never received a phone call after watching the tape as she did at the cabin in Izu.

Back at the cabin, Reiko and Ryūji find a sealed well in the crawlspace. Through another vision, they learn that Dr. Ikuma trapped Sadako inside the well. They conclude that Sadako remained alive and that the curse was born when a videotape ""recorded"" the rage she had projected. When draining the water, they find Sadako's remains. Reiko's 7-day deadline passes, and she remains alive, leading them to believe the curse is broken.

The next day, Ryūji's TV turns on by itself, showing the well at the end of the tape. Sadako's vengeful spirit staggers from the well and out of the TV, advancing toward Ryūji and killing him. Reiko, who had been trying to call Ryūji then, hears his last moments over the phone. Guided by an apparition, Reiko realizes that she unwittingly found the actual way to survive the curse: copying the tape and showing it to someone else within 7 days. Desperate to save Yōichi, Reiko drives to her father's home to show him the tape.

","Critics have discussed Ring's preoccupations with Japanese tradition's collision with modernity. Colette Balmain identifies: ""In the figure of Sadako, Ring [utilises the] vengeful yūrei archetype of conventional Japanese horror"". She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a video tape which ""embodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself"".[5]

Ruth Goldberg argues that Ring expresses ""ambivalence about motherhood"". She reads Reiko as a mother who – due to the new potential for women's independence – neglects her ""natural"" role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a doubling effect whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.[6]

Jay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on.[7] Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.[5]

Title
The film's title, Ring, can be interpreted in several ways, such as alluding to the never ending cyclical nature of the ring curse/virus. Another interpretation is that ""ring"" relates to the phone call which warns those that view the video tape that they will die in seven days,[8] as well as to the view of the ring of light seen from the bottom of the well where Sadako's body was left to decompose.","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Motherhood**: The theme of motherhood is explored through the character of Reiko, who struggles with her role as a mother and her career. Critics have pointed out that Reiko's pursuit of independence causes her to neglect her duties as a mother, which is a core conflict in the story.
   
2. **Other (Ambivalence about Modernity and Tradition)**: The movie melds Japanese traditional archetypes with modern fears—particularly embodied through the videotape. This theme doesn't fit neatly into the predefined categories but is essential in understanding the larger cultural and societal commentary.

### Role of Main Protagonist:

1. **Mother or housewife**: Reiko's role as a mother is central to the plot. Her character is defined by her interaction with her son and her efforts to protect him from the curse.
   
### Monstrous Feminine:

1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Sadako fits multiple aspects of the monstrous feminine as defined by Barbara Creed, including the ""archaic mother,"" ""monstrous womb,"" and ""possessed body."" Sadako's vengeful spirit and her ability to kill from beyond the grave align her with these representations.
   
### Fate of Female Protagonist:

1. **Survives**: Reiko survives by figuring out the curse's mechanism of transferring itself to someone else.

### Focus of the Story:

1. **Victimization**: Despite Reiko's active role in investigating and understanding the curse, the overall tone of the movie and the constant threats she faces focus more on her immediate survival rather than empowerment. The pervasive supernatural threat and the requirement to pass the curse onto someone else for her survival indicate female victimization. 

Reiko's actions are driven largely by the need to survive and protect her son, which limits her empowerment. The narrative places her in the role of someone struggling against forces beyond her control, reinforcing her victimized state.",1,1,1,1,2,2
Watcher,2022,Chloe Okuno,F,Maika Monroe,F,"As a serial killer stalks the city, Julia — a young actress who just moved to town with her husband — notices a mysterious stranger watching her from across the street.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watcher_(film),"American couple Julia and Francis relocate to Bucharest, moving into an apartment building with a large picture window. While Francis works long hours, Julia grows unnerved by a man in the building across the street, who watches her on a daily basis. Her fears are heightened when she learns of a serial killer, dubbed ""the Spider"" by local media, who is decapitating young women. In the city one day, she senses a man following her at a theater and a supermarket. But when Francis and Julia visit the market to review security footage, it proves inconclusive.

Julia befriends her neighbor, Irina, who shows Julia a pistol her boyfriend Cristian gave her for protection. Later that night, Julia waves at the man in the window, and he waves back. Suspecting it's the same man who followed her, she calls the police. Francis accompanies an officer to the building opposite to speak with the man but later tells Julia that she is overreacting.

Soon after, Julia spots the man on the street and follows him to a strip club, where he works as a janitor. Irina, a dancer at the club, spots her. Julia questions Irina about the man, but she knows nothing. At home, Julia has a vivid dream about being attacked and strangled, but awakes only to hear a scream from Irina's apartment and convinces the landlady to unlock it, but they find no sign of Irina.

The next day, Cristian arrives searching for Irina. They try to confront the janitor at his apartment, but no one answers the door. After Christian leaves, Julia works up the nerve to knock on the door herself, but it is answered by an elderly man. As she gets on the elevator to leave, she sees the janitor. That night, a police officer arrives at her apartment accompanied by the man, identified as Daniel Weber, who accuses Julia of stalking him. The officer calls the incident a misunderstanding and Julia shakes Daniel's hand. Francis later shows Julia a news report stating that the Spider has been apprehended.

Julia accompanies Francis to a company party and gleans that he has made jokes about her fears to his coworkers. She angrily leaves and boards the subway, where she notices Daniel in the near-empty car. When he attempts to explain why he watches her—that he lives an isolated, unexciting life caring for his father—Julia notices what appears to be the outline of a severed head in his shopping bag. She returns home and begins packing but is interrupted by music playing in Irina's apartment. Inside, she finds Irina's headless corpse before Daniel smothers her with a plastic bag.

When Julia regains consciousness, Daniel recounts how he killed Irina and hid with her body when Julia and the landlady entered the apartment. Julia hears Francis enter their apartment next door, but when she attempts to scream, Daniel slashes her throat. Francis calls Julia's cell phone, which he hears ringing inside Irina's apartment. He sees Daniel exiting and begins to walk toward him, but Julia, having feigned dying, suddenly kills Daniel with Irina's pistol. She steps out of Irina's apartment, covered in blood, and stares at Francis.",,"Here is the requested analysis of the movie ""Watcher"":

### Role of the Main Protagonist
1. **Other**: Julia does not fall strictly into any of the traditionally female roles listed. She is an adult woman who is neither a mother, adolescent girl, nor involved in professions related to beauty or caretaking. Her role is more defined by her situation as a wife and a foreigner in a new city, which contributes to her vulnerability and isolation.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist

Final Destination 3,2006,James Wong,M,Mary Elizabeth Winstead,F,"A student's premonition of a deadly rollercoaster ride saves her life and a lucky few, but not from death itself – which seeks out those who escaped their fate.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Destination_3,"In 2005, high school student Wendy Christensen visits an amusement park in Pennsylvania with her boyfriend Jason Wise, her best friend Carrie Dreyer, Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer, and their classmates to celebrate their graduation.

As they board the Devil's Flight roller coaster, Wendy has a premonition that a camcorder, dropped by one of her friends during the ride, will land on the ride's tracks and will be run over by the train cars, causing the hydraulics securing the restraints and train cars to fail during the ride, killing everyone on board. She convinces nine people including Kevin, best friends Ashley Freund and Ashlyn Halperin, alumnus Frankie Cheeks, athlete Lewis Romero, and goth couple Ian McKinley and Erin Ulmer, not to ride the roller coaster, but fails to save Jason and Carrie, who are among the remaining passengers killed in the derailment.

Weeks later, Kevin tells Wendy about the explosion of Flight 180 and the survivors' subsequent deaths, believing they may be in a similar situation. At a tanning salon, Ashley and Ashlyn are burnt alive in malfunctioning tanning beds. Now convinced that Death is stalking them, Wendy and Kevin set out to save the remaining survivors using omens hidden in photographs of the survivors that Wendy took on the night of the crash.

When Wendy and Kevin pull into a drive-thru restaurant and observe Frankie's photo, a runaway semi-trailer truck forces them to escape Kevin's truck before it collides. The collision causes the truck's engine to burst out of the hood and grille, killing Frankie, who was in the car in front of them, as the fan sliced his skull. The next day, Wendy and Kevin fail to save Lewis, whose head is crushed by two weights from a weight machine at the school gym. They find Ian and Erin working at a hardware store, where a chain reaction from a runaway forklift allows Wendy to save Ian from his death. However, Death skips to Erin, who falls on a nail gun that shoots repeatedly through her head, killing her.

While identifying the last two survivors from the photographs, whose faces are obscured, Wendy realizes that they are her sister Julie and one of her friends, prompting Wendy and Kevin to rush to the local tricentennial fair to save them. Kevin saves Julie from being impaled on a harrow, but an airborne flagpole fatally impales Julie's friend Perry Malinowski moments later. After Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister, the trio is confronted by a grief-stricken Ian, who blames Wendy for Erin's death, until an unstable cart of firework cannons launches into a cherry picker that falls and crushes him.

Five months later, Wendy experiences more omens while riding on a subway train with her roommate Laura and her friend Sean. As Wendy is about to disembark, she suddenly reunites with Julie and Kevin, who had also boarded the train. Wendy receives another premonition that the train will crash, killing everyone on board. Panicked, the remaining survivors attempt to stop the train as it is about to crash.

The Hunt,2020,Craig Zobel,M,Betty Gilpin,F,"Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they are—or how they got there. In the shadow of a dark internet conspiracy theory, ruthless elitists gather at a remote location to hunt humans for sport. But their master plan is about to be derailed when one of the hunted turns the tables on her pursuers.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_(2020_film),"In a group chat, Athena Stone, Ted, Richard, Miranda, Julius, Peter, Martin, Mike and Liberty discuss an upcoming hunt of ""deplorables"" at a manor.

Later, on Athena's private jet, a flight attendant talks to Richard but is interrupted by Randy, who staggers out from the cargo hold. Ted claims to be a doctor and subdues Randy before Athena kills him.

As the hunt begins, eleven captives consisting of Crystal, Don, Gary, ""Yoga Pants"", ""Target"", ""Dead Sexy"", ""Staten Island"", ""Vanilla Nice"", ""Big Red"", ""Trucker"" and ""Bandana Man"" wake up in a forest, with gags locked in their mouths. Crystal leaves while the rest go into a field and find a crate, which contains a pig and a cache of weapons. Yoga Pants finds the keys to their gags. A rifle is fired at them, killing Yoga Pants. Bandana Man fights back but is also shot and killed. Dead Sexy falls into a spike pit and impales herself. Trucker steps onto a land mine, instantly killing him. Severely injured, Dead Sexy kills herself. Staten Island, Target, Vanilla Nice, and Big Red escape the killing field by climbing a barbed wire fence. Target is shot with an arrow and subsequently killed with a grenade. The other three find a service station, whose owners tell them they are in Arkansas. They realize their situation's similarity to the ""Manorgate"" conspiracy theory after discovering each were kidnapped from a different part of the country.

Big Red eats a poisoned doughnut, and the owners of the service station (Miranda and Julius), kill Staten Island with a shotgun while Vanilla Nice is suffocated with poison gas. They then clean up the station. Crystal arrives and after purchasing cigarettes, notes that they are too expensive for the region, takes the shotgun from under the counter and kills Julius and Miranda.

Inspecting the pickup truck outside and removing fake license plates, Crystal learns she is in Croatia. She also discovers a booby-trap wired to the driver's-side door and warns Gary, a conspiracy theorist podcaster. They board a train full of refugees, whom Gary believes to be crisis actors; the train is then raided by Croatian soldiers. When Gary tries to convince them of Manorgate and the refugees' perfidy, refugee ""Crisis Mike"" admits that he is indeed one of the hunters but the other refugees are innocent. The raid was unplanned, and he offers a head start for Gary's cooperation. Gary wrests a grenade from Mike and uses it to kill him. Crystal is taken to a refugee camp where she meets Don. Oliver, an envoy from the Croatian U.S. Embassy, arrives to extract them but during the drive Crystal becomes suspicious of his comments, kicks Oliver out of the car and runs him over.

She and Don find Gary's body in the trunk with a box marked ""bribe money"" and a map. Crystal tells Don the story of ""the Jackrabbit and the Box Turtle"", in which the Jackrabbit kills the Box Turtle after losing a race with him.[b] At Oliver's intended destination, Crystal kills Richard, Ted, Martin, Peter, Liberty, and injures their tactical consultant Sgt. Dale. Athena calls out to Don via radio, asking if he killed Crystal. Don refuses to disarm aiming his gun at Crystal, who kills him. She tortures Sgt. Dale to get Athena's location - revealing during their exchange that she previously served in Afghanistan - then kills him. In reality, Athena's group text exchange was a joke. However, it was leaked on the internet, creating furor over ""Manorgate"". Subsequently, the group's participants, whose careers were ruined, decide to make Manorgate a reality and abduct those responsible for spreading the conspiracy theory.

Athena had insisted that Crystal be included after seeing a social media post from Crystal that offended her. When they confront each other, Crystal claims that Athena has confused her with another woman from the same city in Mississippi, with a differently spelled middle name, Mae. The two fight and impale one another on the blades of a food processor; Athena dies, but Crystal sees a jackrabbit near the body and regains some strength. She cauterizes her wound, takes Athena's clothes and bag, and leaves on her jet, talking to the same flight attendant from the start of the film.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood

Don't Look Now,1973,Nicolas Roeg,M,Julie Christie,F,"Laura and John, grieved by a terrible loss, meet in Venice, where John is in charge of the restoration of a church, two mysterious sisters, one of whom gives them a message sent from the afterlife.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Now,"Some time after the drowning of their young daughter Christine in an accident at their English country home, John Baxter and his grief-stricken wife Laura travel to Venice where John has accepted a commission from a bishop to restore an ancient church. Laura encounters two elderly sisters, Heather and Wendy, at a restaurant where she and John are dining; Heather claims to be psychic and—despite being blind—informs Laura she is able to ""see"" the Baxters' deceased daughter. Shaken, Laura returns to her table, then faints.

Laura is taken to the hospital, where she later tells John what Heather told her. John is sceptical but pleasantly surprised by the positive change in Laura's demeanour. That evening after returning from the hospital, John and Laura have passionate sex. Afterwards, they go out to dinner, and en route get lost and briefly become separated. John catches a glimpse of a small figure wearing a red coat similar to the one Christine was wearing when she died.

The next day, Laura meets with Heather and Wendy, who hold a séance to try to contact Christine. When she returns to the hotel, Laura informs John that Christine said he is in danger and must leave Venice. John argues with Laura, but that night they receive a telephone call informing them that their son has been injured in an accident at boarding school. Laura departs for England, while John stays on to complete the restoration. Shortly afterwards, John is nearly killed in an accident at the church when the scaffold he is standing on collapses, and he interprets this as the ""danger"" foretold by the sisters.

Later that day, assuming that Laura is in England, John is shocked when he spots her on a passing boat in a funeral cortege, accompanied by the sisters. Concerned about his wife's mental state and with reports of a serial killer at large in Venice, John reports Laura's seeming disappearance to the police. The inspector investigating the killings is suspicious of John and has him followed. After conducting a futile search for Laura and the sisters—during which he again sees the childlike figure in the red coat—John contacts his son's school to enquire about his condition, only to discover that Laura is actually there. After speaking to her to confirm she really is in England, a bewildered John returns to the police station to inform the police he has found his wife. In the meantime, the police have brought Heather in for questioning, and an apologetic John offers to escort her back to the hotel.

Shortly after returning to the hotel, Heather slips into a trance. John quickly leaves. Upon coming out of the trance, Heather pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that something terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches, believing it to be a child. The figure turns to face him, revealing that it is a hideous female dwarf. When John freezes in shock, the dwarf pulls out a meat cleaver and cuts his throat. Dying, John realises too late that the strange sightings he experienced were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.

","Don't Look Now is an occult-themed thriller[3] in which the conventions of the Gothic ghost story serve to explore the minds of a grief-stricken couple.[4] The film's director, Nicolas Roeg, was intrigued by the idea of making ""grief into the sole thrust of the film"", noting that ""Grief can separate people ... Even the closest, healthiest relationship can come undone through grief.""[5] The presence of Christine, the Baxters' deceased daughter, weighs heavily on the mood of the film, as she and the nature of her death are constantly recalled through the film's imagery: there are regular flashbacks to Christine playing in her red coat as well as the sightings of the mysterious childlike figure also wearing a red coat which bears a likeness to her; the constant association of water with death is maintained via a serial-killer sub-plot, which sees victims periodically dragged from the canals; there is also a poignant moment when John fishes a child's doll out of a canal just as he did with his daughter's body at the beginning of the film.[6]


Water and the colour red are recurring motifs.
The associative use of recurring motifs, combined with unorthodox editing techniques, foreshadows key events in the film.[7] In Daphne du Maurier's novella it is Laura that wears a red coat, but in the film the colour is used to establish an association between Christine and the elusive figure that John keeps catching glimpses of.[8][9][10] Du Maurier's story actually opens in Venice following Christine's death from meningitis, but the decision was taken to change the cause of death to drowning and to include a prologue to exploit the water motif.[11] The threat of death from falling is also ever present throughout the film: besides Christine falling into the lake, Laura is taken to hospital after her fall in the restaurant, their son Johnny is injured in a fall at boarding school, the bishop overseeing the church restoration informs John that his father was killed in a fall, and John himself is nearly killed in a fall during the renovations.[12] Glass is frequently used as an omen that something bad is about to occur: just before Christine drowns, John knocks a glass of water over, and Johnny breaks a pane of glass; as Laura faints in the restaurant she knocks glassware off the table, and when John almost falls to his death in the church, a plank of wood shatters a pane of glass; finally, shortly before confronting the mysterious red clad figure, John asks the sisters for a glass of water, an item with a symbolic connection to Christine's death.[7]

The plot of the film is preoccupied with misinterpretation and mistaken identity: when John sees Laura on the barge with the sisters, he fails to realise it is a premonition and believes Laura is in Venice with them.[13] John himself is mistaken for a Peeping Tom when he follows Laura to the séance,[14] and ultimately he mistakes the mysterious red-coated figure for a child. The concept of doppelgänger and duplicates feature prominently in the film: reproductions are a constantly recurring motif ranging from reflections in the water, to photographs, to police sketches and the photographic slides of the church John is restoring. Laura comments in a letter to their son that she can't tell the difference between the restored church windows and the ""real thing"", and later in the film John attempts to make a seamless match between recently manufactured tiles and the old ones in repairing an ancient mosaic.[7] Roeg describes the basic premise of the story as principally being that in life ""nothing is what it seems"",[5] and even decided to have Donald Sutherland's character utter the line—a scene which required fifteen takes.[15]

Communication is a theme that runs through much of Nicolas Roeg's work, and figures heavily in Don't Look Now.[16] This is best exemplified by the blind psychic woman, Heather, who communicates with the dead, but it is presented in other ways: the language barriers are purposefully enhanced by the decision to not include subtitles translating the Italian dialogue into English, so the viewer experiences the same confusion as John.[17] Women are presented as better at communicating than men: besides the clairvoyant being female, it is Laura who stays in regular contact with their son, Johnny;[18] when the Baxters receive a phone call informing them of Johnny's accident at the boarding school, the headmaster's inarticulateness in explaining the situation causes his wife to intercept and explain instead.[12]

Much has been made of the fragmented editing of Don't Look Now, and in Nicolas Roeg's work in general. Time is presented as 'fluid', where the past, present and future can all exist in the same timeframe.[11] John's premonitions merge with the present, such as at the start of the film where the mysterious red-coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides, and when he 'sees' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present, but in fact it is a vision of the future.[13] A prominent use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene, in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner.[4][8] After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments, the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback, which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes.[19] At a narrative level the plot of Don't Look Now can be regarded as a self-fulfilling prophecy: it is John's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death.[13] According to the editor of the film, Graeme Clifford, Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his ""exercise in film grammar"".[20]

Inspirations
Don't Look Now is particularly indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several characteristics of the director's work.[10] The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill is reminiscent of a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train.[21] When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes a suspect in the murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait.[22] The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations of what is going on in his head.[17]

Nicolas Roeg had employed the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg.[23] Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can be traced back to earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red.[24] The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character.[23] The fleeting glimpses of the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings back painful memories of his lost love.[8]

Besides Proust, other possible literary influences include Borges and Nietzsche; Pauline Kael in her review comments that ""Roeg comes closer to getting Borges on the screen than those who have tried it directly"",[25] while Mark Sanderson in his BFI Modern Classics essay on the film, finds parallels with Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil.[13] The film's setting and production status has also drawn comparisons with giallo films, due to its structure, cinematic language and focus on the psychological makeup of its protagonists sharing many characteristics with the Italian subgenre, although Anya Stanley has noted that it lacks the exploitational portrayal of violence and sexuality typically associated with the form.[26] In this regard, Danny Shipka has noted that Don't Look Now bears similarities to Aldo Lado's 1972 giallo Who Saw Her Die?, in which an estranged couple (portrayed by George Lazenby and Anita Strindberg) investigate the drowning death of their daughter. In his view, Aldo ""eliminat[es] a lot of the extreme gore and sex [associated with gialli], but still manages to create an aura of uneasiness with his Venetian locales just as Roeg did a year later"".","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Motherhood**: The film deeply explores themes of grief and loss associated with parenthood, particularly emphasizing the psychological impacts on Laura after the death of her daughter, Christine. The presence of Christine is a constant in the film, influencing Laura’s mental state and actions.
   
2. **Other**: The film focuses heavily on themes of grief, psychological trauma, and the supernatural. The exploration of communication, especially through the clairvoyant abilities of Heather, adds another layer that does not neatly fit into the predefined categories but is pivotal to understanding Laura’s journey.

### Role of Main Protagonist:

1. **Mother or Housewife**: Laura Baxter primarily fits into the role of a grieving mother. Her actions throughout the film are influenced by the loss of her daughter, and her attempts to contact her through the psychic Heather exemplify this.

### Monstrous Feminine Portrayal:

1. **Monstrous Feminine (witch)**: The film does include elements of the ""monstrous feminine"" through the character of Heather, the blind psychic, who communicates with the dead. Her supernatural abilities tie into the archetype of the witch. However, the main protagonist, Laura, is not portrayed as a monster. 

### Ending:

1. **Survives**: Laura Baxter survives at the end of the film.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:

1. **Victimization**: Laura Baxter’s story is more about victimization. Throughout the film, she is subjected to the psychological horror of dealing with her daughter's death and her husband’s eventual murder. Although she tries to gain some form of understanding or control through the psychic medium, she does not attain any real agency or empowerment but is rather engulfed by circumstances and her grief.",1,1,1,1,2,1

As her husband and his family tighten their control over her life, she must confront the dark secret behind her new obsession.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow_(2019_film),"Hunter Conrad, a young woman from a lower-working-class family, has recently married Richie Conrad, a man from a wealthy family who is set to take over as CEO of his father's Manhattan corporation. This affords Hunter the ability to stay at home in the couple's lavish upstate New York home. Despite this, Hunter finds herself emotionally stifled and isolated in both her marriage and domestic life, while Richie is distant and inconsiderate toward her. For example, at a dinner with Richie's parents to congratulate the young couple on their pregnancy, Hunter is enticed to tell a story, only to be interrupted by her father-in-law zoning out and asking Richie about business. One day while home alone, Hunter develops the impulse to eat a marble. She finds it exhilarating and begins to consume other inedible objects around the house, including thumbtacks, metal figurines, and batteries.

During a routine ultrasound, the sonogram technician notices an anomaly in her abdomen. She is rushed in for emergency surgery to remove a variety of objects trapped in her intestine. Hunter is diagnosed with pica, a psychological disorder that compels individuals to eat inedible objects. Richie's parents, Katherine and Michael, arrange for her to see a psychiatrist in the city. During her therapy sessions, Hunter says she swallows the objects because she likes the feel of their textures in her mouth.

Richie hires Luay, a family friend and immigrant from Syria, to monitor Hunter while he is at work. Hunter, feeling smothered, is initially hostile toward Luay, who dismisses her mental illness as resulting from her privileged life. In therapy, she eventually reveals she was not raised by her biological father and has never met him, though she knows his name and keeps a picture of him. She was conceived as a result of her mother's rape at the hands of a strange man she had met in a bar. The rapist served time in prison for the crime.

One afternoon, Hunter overhears Richie speaking with her psychiatrist on the phone, and realizes Richie has bribed the doctor to tell him what was discussed in Hunter's therapy sessions. This sends Hunter into a panic, and she swallows a miniature screwdriver. Luay finds her choking violently and calls 9-1-1. After undergoing surgery to remove the screwdriver, Michael and Katherine arrange to have Hunter committed to a psychiatric hospital for the next seven months until she delivers the baby, threatening that Richie will divorce her. Luay, who has warmed to Hunter, allows her to flee into the woods, and stages it to appear as though she had escaped.

Hunter hitchhikes to a motel and calls Richie, who begs her to return. She explains she had rushed into their marriage and pregnancy to make him happy. When she refuses to come back, he chastises and insults her. Hunter smashes her cell phone and spends the rest of the night watching television and eating soil from outside. The next day, she hitchhikes to the home of her biological father, William Erwin. At William's house, he is celebrating his birthday with family and friends. He and his wife Lucy assume Hunter is the parent of one of their daughter's friends, but she privately reveals her true identity to William. During an emotional conversation, William professes his shame for raping Hunter's mother. Hunter asks him if he is ashamed of her and whether she is like him, both of which he denies.

Having obtained closure, Hunter visits a clinic and is prescribed medication to induce an abortion. She takes the pills while eating lunch in a food court and experiences the abortion in a public restroom.

Twelve years later, the Mullins open their home to provide shelter for Sister Charlotte and six girls left homeless by the closing of their orphanage. Despite having been warned to avoid Bee's locked bedroom, Janice, a young orphan disabled by polio, discovers a note saying ""Find me"" and sneaks into the room, which has mysteriously become unlocked. She finds a key for Bee's closet and opens it, where she sees an eerie porcelain doll. This unwittingly releases a powerful demon that begins to terrorize the girls.

One night, the demon, taking Bee's form, appears to Janice, saying that it wants her soul. Although she attempts to get away using a stairlift, the demon recalls the stairlift and hurls her violently down to the ground floor, leaving her severely injured and confined to a wheelchair. With Janice now confined to the first floor, her best friend Linda is now having to sleep alone and is tormented by the demon.

One morning, the demon, posing as Sister Charlotte, wheels Janice into the old barn, where, in the form of Bee, it attacks and possesses her after throwing up black bile directly into Janice's mouth. Linda notices changes in Janice's behavior and tells Samuel that Janice snuck into Bee's room and found the doll. Samuel immediately believes Linda and heads inside where he comes across Janice, who can now walk. Janice transforms into the demon and brutally kills Samuel who follows her while holding a crucifix, forcing him to drop it after moving his fingers backwards one by one. Outside, Sister Charlotte hears his screams and is horrified to find him dead on the floor.

That evening Linda takes Janice's doll and throws it into the well. A strange noise comes from the well and she is almost dragged into it, but Sister Charlotte saves her. Upon returning inside to find Janice gone from the couch, Sister Charlotte wakes the orphans who go look for her as an alarmed Sister Charlotte speaks with the disfigured Esther, who is confined to her bedroom. Esther reveals that after Bee's death, they prayed to whatever entity would grant their wish to see their daughter again. An unknown entity answered their prayer and though they briefly saw Bee's spirit, the entity convinced them to transfer its essence into one of Samuel's crafted dolls. They happily agreed but soon realized they had attracted a demon looking for a human host. One night, Esther saw Bee's spirit transforming into the demon, which then gouged out her eye and resulted in her wearing a half doll-like mask to conceal her injury and the scars. Enlisting the help of priests to bless the house, they locked the doll in Bee's closet. Esther and Samuel opened their house as a shelter for orphan children to repent for their actions, but Esther now regrets it since this has provided an opportunity for the demon to look for a human host. The demon then murders Esther and attacks Sister Charlotte. While some of the orphans are able to leave the house, Linda is trapped and hides in Bee's room as the possessed Janice tries to stab her. Sister Charlotte locks Janice and the doll inside the closet.

The next day, police arrive to search the house and find only the doll, which they remove as evidence but not before a priest blesses the home. Sister Charlotte, Linda, and the orphans are escorted away by officers to find another new home for the orphans, while Janice escapes through a hole in the closet wall and relocates to an orphanage in Santa Monica. Still possessed, she becomes reclusive and calls herself Annabelle. Pete and Sharon Higgins soon adopt Annabelle.

Halloween II,1981,Rick Rosenthal,M,Jamie Lee Curtis,F,"After failing to kill stubborn survivor Laurie and taking a bullet or six from former psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis, Michael Myers has followed Laurie to the Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, where she's been admitted for Myers' attempt on her life. The institution proves to be particularly suited to serial killers, however, as Myers cuts, stabs and slashes his way through hospital staff to reach his favorite victim.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_II_(1981_film),"On October 31, 1978, Michael Myers is shot by his psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis and falls off a balcony. He survives his wounds and escapes into the night. Wandering the alleys, he steals a kitchen knife from an elderly couple and kills the teenage girl next door. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode, who narrowly avoided being killed that night, is taken to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital while Loomis continues his pursuit of Michael, accompanied by Sheriff Leigh Brackett. Loomis mistakes teenager Ben Tramer for Michael due to Ben wearing a similar mask, resulting in Ben being hit by a police car and burning to death. The bodies of Annie Brackett, Lynda Van der Klok and Bob Simms are discovered by the police at residence of the Wallace. Upon learning his daughter has been killed by Michael, Sheriff Brackett blames Loomis and abandons the search, leaving Deputy Gary Hunt to take his place.

At the hospital, paramedic Jimmy develops an attraction to Laurie, but head nurse Virginia Alves limits the time he spends with her. After hearing a newsflash revealing Laurie's location, Michael makes his way to the hospital, where he cuts the phone lines and disables all the cars in the parking lot by slashing all the cars’ tires so no one can escape and call for help. Wandering the halls in search of Laurie, he kills the security guard, the doctor, paramedic, and several nurses throughout the night. In her hospital room, Laurie dreams about the time she learned she was adopted, and remembers she once visited a young Michael at the sanitarium. Jimmy and nurse Jill Franco grow increasingly concerned when they discover that more and more staff have gone missing throughout the night and search the hospital for Laurie, who is trying to evade Michael. As nurse Jill Franco tries to start the car to drive to the sheriff’s department, it fails to start and she sees that all the car’s tires in the parking lot have been slashed.

After finding Mrs. Alves dead, strapped to a gurney with an empty IV needle in her arm draining all of her blood out of her body, Jimmy turns to run to go for help but he slips in a pool of her blood and knocks himself unconscious, giving himself a concussion. Meanwhile, police are informed that Michael broke into the local elementary school earlier. Loomis rides with them. His colleague Marion Chambers arrives to escort him back to Smith's Grove on the governor's orders and under the enforcement of a US Marshal. On the way, she tells him that Laurie is Michael's younger sister; she was put up for adoption after the death of Michael's parents, with the records sealed to protect the family.

Realizing that Michael is after Laurie and being told she was brought to Haddonfield Memorial Hospital, Loomis forces the marshal at gunpoint to drive back to Haddonfield. Jill finally finds Laurie, only to be killed by Michael, who then pursues Laurie through the hospital. She manages to escape to the parking lot and hides in a car. Jimmy regains consciousness and soon arrives and tries to start and drive the car to safety, but passes out again due to the concussion sustained from the slip and fall causing the horn to blare, attracting Michael's attention. Loomis, Marion, and the marshal reach the hospital just in time to save Laurie. Loomis shoots Michael until he falls down, seemingly dead. While Marion calls the police on the marshal's radio, the marshal tries to check Michael's pulse as Loomis warns him to stay away, knowing he isn't dead. Michael revives and slits the marshal's throat with a scalpel.

Loomis and Laurie run into an operating room, where he gives her the marshal's gun before being stabbed by Michael. Laurie shoots Michael in both eyes, blinding him. As he swings the scalpel around the space violently, the two fill the room with flammable gas. Loomis orders Laurie to get out before igniting the gas, immolating himself and Michael in an explosion. Laurie watches as Michael, engulfed in flames, emerges from the fire before finally collapsing. The next morning, she is transferred to another hospital, traumatized but alive.

Unfriended,2014,Levan Gabriadze,M,Shelley Hennig,F,"While video chatting one night, six high school friends receive a Skype message from a classmate who killed herself exactly one year ago. At first they think it's a prank, but when the girl starts revealing the friends' darkest secrets, they realize they are dealing with something out of this world, something that wants them dead.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfriended,"In Fresno, California, high school student Laura Barns commits suicide by gunshot after an anonymous user uploads a video of her passing out and defecating at an unsupervised party, making it go viral. One year later, her former childhood best friend Blaire Lily is chatting with her boyfriend Mitch Roussel on Skype, during which they agree to lose their virginities to each other on prom night. Soon after they are joined by their friends and classmates Jess Felton, Ken Smith, and Adam Sewell, and an unknown user known as ""billie227.""

The group of friends tries various ways to get rid of the intruder but are unsuccessful each time. Blaire looks up the account and realizes that it belonged to Laura Barns, revealing ""billie227"" as Laura even though the friends are still incredulous about this possibility. The group suspects that a classmate, Val Rommel, is pranking them. After they invite Val to their chat, Jess' Facebook page is updated with embarrassing photos of Val at a party. Jess denies uploading the photos and deletes them from her account, but the pictures instantly reappear on Adam's account. Val receives a message of a picture not visible to the others, which she considers a threat. Angry, she calls 911 to report that she is being harassed, and abruptly leaves the chat. The group receives a photo of Val and Laura's Facebook messages from before Laura's death, with Val telling Laura to kill herself. Val reappears on the chat, sitting motionless and silent next to a bottle of bleach before collapsing. Police officers arrive shortly after; the friends eavesdrop and learn that Val died from a presumed suicide. Laura then sends each of the friends a personalized message proving intimate knowledge of their secrets; in Blaire's case, which is the one visible to the audience, this turns out to be several pictures revealing that she had an affair with Adam. Ken distributes a program to remove Laura from the chat, and then Adam attempts to call the police. However, the 911 operator turns out to be the intruder and re-enters the chat, revealing a camera view from the other side of Ken's room. He approaches the camera source and his Skype is briefly cut before it shows him killing himself with a blender.

Laura forces the remaining four friends to play a game of Never Have I Ever, stating that the loser will die. During the course of the game, it is revealed that Jess started a rumor that Blaire had an eating disorder; Blaire stole and crashed Jess' mother's car; Mitch made out with Laura (although he says it was one-sided on her end and he pushed her off), and also reported Adam to the police for dealing cannabis; Jess stole $800 from Adam; and Adam offered to trade Jess' life for the others in the group. Tensions flare and a drunken Adam finally loses his temper and uses the game to force Blaire to reveal that she is no longer a virgin, having slept with him behind Mitch's back. Mitch is distraught and retaliates by forcing Adam to admit that he roofied a classmate, raped her while she was unconscious, and then forced her to abort the resulting pregnancy.

Blaire and Adam receive messages sent remotely to their printers which they refuse to show to Mitch and Jess. Mitch threatens to leave if Blaire does not show the note and Laura warns that Mitch will die if he signs off. In a moment of panic, Blaire shows her paper which states: ""If you reveal this note, Adam will die."" Adam shoots himself, revealing he had the same note, except it was for Blaire.

Laura continues the game, asking Jess if she defaced her grave. When Blaire convinces Jess not to continue playing, Laura cuts the lights in Jess' house and disconnects her video feed. Blaire looks for help on Chatroulette and has a stranger in Nevada send police to Jess' house. Soon after, Jess' Skype reconnects showing her with an activated curling iron in her mouth, killing her.

Laura cuts the lights in Blaire's and Mitch's houses, wanting them to confess who uploaded the video. Blaire tells her that Mitch was the one who posted it; Mitch then stabs himself in the eye with a hunting knife. Laura issues another countdown, and as Blaire brings up photos of their time as friends, apologizing about how they drifted apart, Laura asks if that was how she truly remembered things, before the countdown hit zero. Laura then uploads an extended version of the party video to Blaire's Facebook which reveals Blaire operating the camera for the original video and laughing, which quickly gains attention, with multiple people sending hateful comments towards Blaire. Laura says that she wishes she could forgive Blaire before leaving the chat. As Blaire hears her bedroom door creak, Laura, now in the form of her spirit, slams Blaire's laptop shut. Blaire then faintly whispers Laura's name before being attacked.

Host,2020,Rob Savage,M,Haley Bishop,F,"Six friends hire a medium to hold a séance via Zoom during lockdown — but they get far more than they bargained for as things quickly go wrong. When an evil spirit starts invading their homes, they begin to realize they might not survive the night.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(film),"During a July 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in London, friends Haley, Jemma, Radina, Emma, Caroline, and Teddy join the weekly Zoom call they have been using to stay in touch. Haley has arranged for them to partake in a virtual séance led by the medium Seylan, who emphasises that they should not disrespect the spirits, though only Haley takes it seriously. Teddy is forced to leave the call when his girlfriend Jinny disconnects him. Jemma claims to feel intense tension around her neck and begins to cry, explaining that she feels the presence of a school friend who killed himself by hanging. Seylan's internet cuts out and disconnects her from the call, prompting a laughing Jemma to admit to the group that she made her deceased friend up because she was getting bored, which angers Haley. The remaining members begin to experience terrifying phenomena: Haley's chair is violently pulled backwards by an unseen force, the legs of a hanging corpse briefly appear in Caroline's attic when she goes to investigate a noise, and Emma's wine glass shatters even though nobody is holding it. Haley points her instant camera down the hallway to take a photo of her living room, which shows a ghostly figure hanging from the ceiling.

As the girls panic, Haley manages to get back in touch with Seylan and tell her what happened, prompting Seylan to ask the spirit a series of yes or no questions; using this method, she quickly confirms that the spirit is not a friendly one. Seylan explains that Jemma's prank, which involved fabricating a deceased person, may have led a tulpa to take on the guise of the deceased person and wear his identity like a mask that allows the demon to pass into the world of the living. She gives them instructions on how to close the séance, but the demon interrupts her and she is disconnected again before the girls attempt to close the circle using her advice. Relieved that the ordeal seems to be over, the members of the group begin to leave the call. Radina leaves the room, unaware of her boyfriend Alan's body hanging behind her. Caroline's Zoom background, which shows a looping video of her doing chores, continues playing as the real Caroline suddenly has her face smashed into the camera. Forgetting to switch off a filter that superimposes masks and face paint onto her, Emma turns her camera towards her living room, where the filter places a kabuki mask on an invisible figure which then turns to look at her. She runs away and scatters flour on the floor, showing the footprints of the demon approaching her. Her kitchen cupboards burst open before the demon attacks her, but she escapes into her bedroom.

Radina attempts to flee after Alan's body drops down behind her, but the demon kills her by throwing her into the wall. Noticing that Caroline is typing gibberish in the chat, Haley and Jemma watch as her camera turns back on to show her being killed by the demon repeatedly smashing her head into her keyboard while she pleads for help. Haley and Jemma argue and blame each other before Haley is pulled out of the room. Jemma, who lives around the corner from Haley, immediately leaves her home to help. Teddy returns to the call to see that only Emma remains, and a warning pops up to remind the group that the call will end in 10 minutes unless they upgrade to the premium version of Zoom. Unaware of everything that has occurred, Teddy believes Emma is pranking him, but he is attacked by the demon after it takes the form of a horrifying humanoid figure. He is chased into his garden, where he sees Jinny being lifted into the air before her neck is snapped and her body falls into the swimming pool. He runs away and hides, using a lighter to see where he is going, but the demon distracts him with an eerie music box his brother used to prank him with as a child. The demon then knocks him down and he drops the lighter, causing a fire that burns him to death.

Emma, now the only person still active in the call, fearfully turns her camera towards the door of her room after it opens. She throws a blanket, which drapes itself over an invisible human shape. She opens her window to escape, but trips and falls to her death. Jemma breaks into Haley's home and checks the Zoom call on Haley's laptop to see that Emma and Teddy are dead. The demon smashes a wine bottle over her head and starts to destroy the kitchen, but she recovers and finds Haley hiding under her desk, with the pair attempting to escape the house using the flash of Haley's instant camera to light the way. The demon appears in the final flash of light, taking the form of a mutilated human, and rushes at them as the Zoom call timer expires.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Gender based violence**: The plot involves a group of women subjected to terrifying and violent phenomena perpetrated by a demon. The violence inflicted upon them could be interpreted as a metaphor for real-world gender-based violence.
2. **Other (Friendship and trust)**: The story revolves around a group of friends and explores how betrayal (Jemma fabricating the presence of a deceased person) leads to tragic consequences, indicating themes of friendship and the breakdown of trust.

### Protagonist's Role
1. **Other**: The main characters are a group of friends, and their roles are not particularly tied to traditional female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. They are not mothers, housewives, adolescents, or professionals related to beauty, perfection, or caretaking. Instead, they are portrayed as regular individuals—likely students or young professionals—connecting with each other during a pandemic lockdown.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Other**: The female protagonists are victims rather than embodying the 'Monstrous Feminine' trope. The demon, which is the true source of horror, does not appear to be a representation of the ""monstrous-feminine"" as described by Barbara Creed.

### Protagonist's Fate
1. **Dies**: Almost all the main female characters die by the end of the movie, except for Haley and Jemma, whose fates are left ambiguous but heavily implied to be grim given the final rush of the demon in the last flash.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment
1. **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on female victimization. The characters are subjected to physical and psychological threats for most of the movie. They do not gain significant agency or autonomy and are mostly trying to survive the horror unfolding around them. Their attempts to regain control (calling the medium back, trying to close the séance) are ultimately unsuccessful.",2,5,2,1,1,1
Funny Games,2007,Michael Haneke,M,Naomi Watts,F,"When Ann, husband George, and son Georgie arrive at their holiday home they are visited by a pair of polite and seemingly pleasant young men. Armed with deceptively sweet smiles and some golf clubs, they proceed to terrorize and torture the tight-knit clan, giving them until the next day to survive.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funny_Games_(2007_film),"George and Ann Farber, their son Georgie, and their dog Lucky arrive at their lake house. Their next door neighbor Fred comes over with two young men, Paul and Peter, to help put the boat into the lake, though Fred is behaving strangely.

While Ann is cooking, Peter visits and asks to borrow some eggs. She gives him the eggs, he leaves, and once out of sight drops the eggs, then returning to apologize for his clumsiness and ask for more. She gives him four more eggs and he leaves, but Lucky jumps on him, breaking the eggs. To Ann's frustration, Paul implores her to test one of his golf clubs outside, and Peter requests more eggs. George arrives and tries to oust them, ultimately slapping Paul. In retaliation, Peter bashes George's knee with the golf club. The two men then take the family hostage.

Paul guides Ann on a game of ""Hot and Cold"" to find Lucky, whom he had killed with the golf club. When their neighbors, the Thompsons, visit, Ann claims Paul and Peter are simply friends of theirs. After returning home, the Farbers are forced to participate in a number of sadistic games in order to stay alive, during which they put Georgie's head in a pillowcase and ask Ann to strip naked. Georgie is hurt by Paul until she complies. When released from the pillowcase, Georgie escapes and goes to Fred's house, where he discovers bloody corpses.

Meanwhile, Paul ties Ann up before going out to search for Georgie, leaving Peter to watch over the Farbers. Ann asks why they do not directly kill them, and Peter answers that they should not forget the fun of the games. When Peter goes to the kitchen to get eggs, Ann jumps to George but George fails to free her before Peter comes back, and Peter beats her and breaks the eggs again. Ann begs Peter to let them go, but he refuses. Georgie finds a shotgun in Fred's house and Paul tells him to go ahead and shoot him with it, but the gun fails to go off, revealing the gun to be empty. Paul returns him to the living room, and gives the shotgun to Peter, and reveals the two missing shotgun shells.

The men play a new game, saying whoever gets counted out will be shot. While Paul is in the kitchen getting something to eat, Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting and killing him. Paul berates Peter for being trigger-happy, and the two men decide to briefly leave. George and Ann are grief-stricken over their loss, but they eventually resolve to survive. Ann is able to free herself and flee the house while George desperately tries to make a call on the malfunctioning phone. Ann fails to find help, only to be re-captured by Peter and Paul, who bring her back to the house.

The next level of games begin with Peter stabbing George. They tell Ann to say a prayer before making a choice for her husband; a painful and prolonged death with the ""little"" knife, or a quick and brutal death with the ""big"" shotgun. While Paul is talking, Ann seizes the shotgun on the table in front of her and kills Peter. An enraged Paul grabs the shotgun and starts looking for the television remote. Upon finding it, he rewinds the last occurrences back to a moment before Ann grabs the shotgun, breaking the fourth wall. On the ""do over"", Paul snatches the shotgun away before she can grab it and admonishes her, saying she is not allowed to break the rules.

Peter and Paul kill George and take Ann, bound and gagged, out onto the family's boat. Ann tries to free herself but is caught by Paul and Peter. Paul nonchalantly pushes her into the water to drown. They knock on the door of the Thompsons' house and request some eggs. Paul glances at the camera with a smirk.","Haneke states that the entire film was not intended to be a horror film. He says he wanted to make a message about violence in the media by making an incredibly violent, but otherwise pointless movie.

A thief steals the genetically engineered T-virus and contaminates the Hive with it. In response, the facility's artificial intelligence, the Red Queen, seals the Hive and kills everyone inside to prevent the virus from leaking into the outside world.

Alice awakens in the bathroom of a deserted mansion, suffering amnesia. She is tackled by an unknown person as a group of commandos led by James Shade breaks in. Alice's attacker claims to be Matt Addison, who just transferred as a cop in Raccoon P.D. Alice and Matt are ordered to go down to the Hive with the group, where they find another amnesiac, Spence, hidden in their train. The commandos explain that everyone in the group except Matt is an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, and Alice and her partner Spence were assigned to guard the Hive's secret entrance beneath the mansion under the pretense of being married.

At the Red Queen's chamber, a laser defense system kills Shade and three more commandos. Despite the Red Queen's pleas for the group to leave, Kaplan disables it, causing the power to fail and all of the doors in the Hive to open. This releases the zombified staff and containment units holding Lickers, creatures created through experimentation with the T-virus. The humans are attacked by the horde, and J.D. dies while the rest are separated. Alice starts regaining her memories while Matt finds his sister Lisa zombified. Alice saves him, and Matt explains that he and Lisa were environmental activists. Lisa infiltrated Umbrella to smuggle out the evidence of illegal experiments and shut Umbrella down. Alice remembers that she was Lisa's contact in the Hive but does not tell Matt. The survivors reunite at the Red Queen's chamber, where the commandos explain they have one hour before the Hive traps them inside automatically. Alice and Kaplan activate the Red Queen to find an exit; to force her cooperation, they rig a remote shutdown.

As they escape through maintenance tunnels, zombies ambush them, and a reanimated J.D. bites Rain before she shoots him dead. They reach safety except Kaplan, who is bitten and separated from the group. Alice remembers that an anti-virus is in the lab, but they find it missing. She also remembers that Spence was the thief who stole and purposefully released the T-virus in the beginning; he hid both the T-virus and anti-virus on the train. Spence turns against the others but is bitten by a zombie before trapping the survivors in the lab. Spence retrieves the anti-virus but is killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, who has been infected. A power outage occurs. Kaplan appears, having shut down the Red Queen to open the lab doors. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the anti-virus and kills a reanimated Spence.

On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan with the anti-virus. The Licker attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is attacked by a zombified Rain, the anti-virus having failed to cure her. He shoots Rain dead.

At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, a group of Umbrella scientists seizes them. They reveal Matt is to be put into the Nemesis Program, and the Hive is to be re-opened for an investigation into the incident.

Sometime later, Alice awakens at the Raccoon City Hospital strapped to an examination table. She escapes outside, only to find Raccoon City in ruins. She retrieves a shotgun from an abandoned police car for defense.",,"**Resident Evil**

Lester slips away and Sadie finds his body hanging in her mother's art closet.

Soon afterwards, Sadie notices a strange mold beginning to form around the house while Sawyer glimpses a sinister creature under her bed. This creature continues to terrorize Sawyer while Sadie suspects the phenomenon is related to Lester's suicide. She visits the Billings' rundown house. Inside, she discovers Rita, the now-unhinged wife of Lester. Rita identifies the creature as ""The Boogeyman"", the culprit behind her children's deaths. The creature feeds off fear and grief and can mimic voices. The only way to ward it off is by light. Feeling unsafe around Rita, Sadie flees.

During a sleepover with a group of girls from her school, Sadie encounters the Boogeyman and Sawyer is attacked shortly thereafter, ending up hospitalized.

Dawn of the Dead,2004,Zack Snyder,M,Sarah Polley,F,"A group of survivors take refuge in a shopping mall after the world is taken over by aggressive, flesh-eating zombies.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Dead_(2004_film),"After finishing a long shift as a nurse in the Milwaukee area, Ana returns to her suburban neighborhood and her husband, Luis. Caught up in a scheduled date night, they unintentionally ignore an emergency news bulletin. The next morning, a zombified neighborhood girl, Vivian, enters their bedroom and kills Luis, who immediately reanimates and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon awakening, Ana joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombified security guard, who scratches Luda. Three living guards — C.J., Bart, and Terry — force them to surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot. The group notices a military helicopter flying overhead and attempts to get the pilot's attention, but to no avail.

The next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. C.J. and Bart wish to turn them away but are overruled and disarmed. The newcomers include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside via wheelbarrow, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Andre leaves to see Luda, who has kept her scratch hidden from the group. They realize that Frank has been bitten and is a potential threat. After some debate, Frank elects to be isolated. When he dies and turns, Kenneth shoots him.

Kenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard; romance also buds between Ana and Michael, and Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, C.J., Bart, Michael and Kenneth go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator; they find a friendly dog named Chips, and worry about a breach. Zombies attack and kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda — tied up by Andre — gives birth and dies. She reanimates as Norma checks on the couple. When Norma kills the zombified Luda, Andre snaps; they exchange gunfire and both are killed. The others arrive to find a zombie infant, which they kill immediately. The group decides to fight their way to the local marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape.

To rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto Chips's body and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows through the dog door. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where a now zombified Andy traps her. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation via the buses.

While navigating through the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica; blood splatters on the windshield, causing their bus to crash. Steve leaves the group and is killed by a stowaway zombie. While C.J., Kenneth, and Terry look for survivors, Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina, C.J. sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Michael reveals a bite wound, killing himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht. Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows Steve's escapades before the outbreak and concludes as the group runs out of supplies, approaches an island, and is attacked by a swarm of zombies before the camcorder drops.","With Dawn of the Dead, Gunn wanted to explore the human condition as well as tell a wholly different story about redemption.[19] He elaborated on the redemptive theme of the film in an interview with IGN during a press junket for Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed released that same year:

[...] Dawn of the Dead is about redemption because it's about a bunch of people who have lived certain lives, who have maybe not been the best people, and suddenly they have everything that they've used to define themselves: Their careers, their churches, their jobs, their families are stripped away. They're gone. They start at nothing and they have to become who they really are in the face of all that and some of the people are redeemed and end up becoming good people and some of them are not redeemed and they end up, you know, not redeemed. And that's what kind of drove me throughout the story, was it was a story about redemption. I also think that there's a lot about how people survive and what people turn to in the face of such tragedy. The tragedy in this case being flesh-eating zombies. And really it's a group coming together to work as a community who wouldn't otherwise work together. So there is that foundation of love, that basic message, within even Dawn of the Dead...","### Themes Related to Womanhood:

Happy Death Day 2U,2019,Christopher Landon,M,Jessica Rothe,F,"Collegian Tree Gelbman wakes up in horror to learn that she's stuck in a parallel universe. Her boyfriend Carter is now with someone else, and her friends and fellow students seem to be completely different versions of themselves. When Tree discovers that Carter's roommate has been altering time, she finds herself once again the target of a masked killer. When the psychopath starts to go after her inner circle, Tree soon realizes that she must die over and over again to save everyone.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Death_Day_2U,"One day after the events of Happy Death Day, college student Ryan Phan wakes up in his car on September 19. Returning to his dorm room, he walks in on his roommate Carter and Carter's girlfriend, Tree. He resumes work on an experimental quantum reactor with fellow students Samar and Dre to try to slow down time. After Bronson, the school dean, shuts down the project for causing several power outages and has shown to have no practical applications so far, Ryan is murdered by someone dressed as school mascot Babyface and wakes up again on the 19th. Tree explains her experience reliving September 18th, and she and Carter agree to help Ryan. They learn the reactor was responsible for creating the loop. The masked killer tracks Ryan down, but Tree unmasks him to reveal another Ryan. The second Ryan warns that the original must die for the loop to close. Terrified, Ryan activates the reactor, releasing an energy pulse that knocks everyone unconscious.

Tree wakes up in Carter's room on September 18 and relives her original time loop, but she soon realizes things are different after discovering that Carter is now dating Danielle. Ryan theorizes that the reactor caused Tree to drift into another dimension. When Tree learns her mother is still alive in this new reality, she wants to stay.

That night, Tree goes to the hospital to intercept serial killer John Tombs before he escapes, but she is confronted by a police officer. The killer kills the officer, and Tree runs into Lori at the elevator, realizing Lori is not the killer in this reality. Lori tells Tree that the killer cannot be Tombs because she just took him in for surgery. The killer stabs Lori, then chases Tree to the roof, where she accidentally falls to her death. She wakes at the beginning of her loop and demands that Ryan and his team help her escape it, requiring they test dozens of algorithms. At Carter's suggestion, Tree serves as the group's recorder, killing herself at the end of each day so they can start again. Eventually, her injuries catch up with her, and she faints. Waking up in the hospital, Tree steals a gun to go after Tombs, only to find Lori already dead. Tombs, disguised as Babyface, attacks, and Tree shoots him dead. However, a second Babyface killer appears, forcing Tree to kill herself and the killer.

The group finally discovers the correct algorithm, but a technical issue forces a delay. Faced with a choice of which reality she wants to be in when both time loops close, Tree decides to remain in the current dimension. Carter urges Tree to consider the consequences of living a life that is not truly hers and states that her experience with grief helped shape the person she is now. Tree hides from the killer in a hotel, but that evening, the news reports that Carter was murdered trying to save Lori at the hospital. Tree kills herself by exploding a power station, deactivating the reactor so she can save Carter and Lori. The loop restarts and Tree decides to return to her own reality. She advises Lori to end her affair with her professor Gregory Butler, discovers that Danielle is cheating on Carter, and has a final conversation with her mother.

Bronson confiscates the reactor before the group can activate it. Believing she is too weak to survive another loop, Tree insists they retrieve the device. The group enlists Danielle to distract Bronson while they recover the reactor. As Ryan readies the device, Tree goes to the hospital to rescue Lori from Tombs but is trapped by the second Babyface killer—revealed to be Dr. Butler trying to bury the evidence of his affair with Lori. Dr. Butler's wife Stephanie appears and shoots Lori, revealing she is in league with her husband, but he betrays and kills her as well. In the ensuing confrontation, Tree outsmarts Butler and kills him. Lori survives, and Tree and Carter kiss as the reactor activates, sending Tree back to her original dimension on September 19.

Later, Tree, Carter, Ryan, Samar, and Dre are escorted by agents to a DARPA laboratory, where the reactor has been moved for further experimentation. When the agents say they need a test subject in order to see how the machine works, Tree says she knows the perfect one. In her bedroom, Danielle wakes up, screaming in horror.",,"**Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. Motherhood: Tree's deep emotional connection with her mother and her desire to stay in the alternate dimension where her mother is still alive showcases the theme of motherhood. This connection and the grieving process she undergoes highlight the maternal bond.
2. Gender based violence: The presence of a masked killer who targets Tree and her friends repeatedly can be interpreted as gender-based violence, especially considering the repeated physical assaults Tree endures.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
1. Other: Tree Gelbman does not fit neatly into the traditional categories outlined. She is a college student, which doesn't fit precisely into the roles of mother/housewife, adolescent girl, professional related to beauty or perfection, or professional related to caretaking. Her status as a college student and her active role in resolving the crisis place her outside of these predefined categories.

**Monstrous Femme:**
1. Other: Tree is not portrayed as a monster in the story. Though she endures horrific situations and repeatedly faces and overcomes physical threats, she does not embody any of the monstrous-feminine archetypes like archaic mother, monstrous womb, vampire, witch, possessed body, monstrous mother, or castrator.

**Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?:**
1. Survives: Tree survives at the end of the movie.

**Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:**
1. Empowerment: The story ultimately focuses on female empowerment. Tree is portrayed with dimensionality, and the audience can empathize with her desires and actions. She gains agency and autonomy throughout the movie's runtime, taking control over her own story, resolving the time loop, and outsmarting her antagonists.",2,5,2,2,2,1
Underwater,2020,William Eubank,M,Kristen Stewart,F,"After an earthquake destroys their underwater station, six researchers must navigate two miles along the dangerous, unknown depths of the ocean floor to make it to safety in a race against time.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_(film),"In 2050, the Kepler 822, a research and drilling facility operated by Tian Industries at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, is struck by what is assumed to be a strong earthquake. As part of the facility is destroyed by the incident, mechanical engineer Norah Price and her colleagues, Rodrigo and Paul, make their way to the escape pod bay. However, the three discover that all of the escape pods have already been deployed, with Captain Lucien being the only person in the area when the three arrive.

Together, they reach a control base and find biologist Emily Haversham and engineer Liam Smith, who are unsuccessful in their attempts to make contact with the surface. Lucien suggests using pressurized suits to walk one mile across the ocean floor to Roebuck 641 in the hope of resurfacing from there. As they descend in a freight elevator, Rodrigo's defective helmet implodes under the water pressure, killing him. The surviving crew sees a distress beacon from one of the escape pods below, and Smith and Paul go to investigate.

As they arrive at the location, they find a body in the rubble. A creature emerges from the corpse's back and attacks them. Smith kills the creature and takes it inside. Haversham examines the creature and realizes that it belongs to a previously undiscovered species.

The five make their way to the sea floor, but as they are walking, the Kepler explodes above and nearly buries them in debris. Smith is hit, but Price and Lucien save him. They manage to get through an access tunnel to an intermediate station, where they can charge and clean their suits. However, they find that Smith's oxygen scrubber is badly damaged from the debris.

On their way through the access tunnel, Paul is attacked by an unknown creature, dragged underwater, and killed. Before the team leaves the access tunnel, they find that Smith's damaged oxygen pod will cause him to suffocate from the explosion's toxic fumes. Unwilling to leave another crew member behind, Price, Lucien, and Haversham agree to help Smith walk.

The four set off across the ocean floor, but a humanoid creature appears and drags Smith into a cave. Lucien manages to get Smith out, but he is pulled from the other three. Price is dragged along with Lucien, but Lucien sacrifices himself to spare Price from the increasing pressure differential.

Price ends up at the abandoned Shepard station alone and is able to change her damaged diving suit before continuing toward Roebuck. Walking along the ocean floor, she reunites with Haversham and Smith and proceeds to help drag Smith.

As they enter Roebuck, they encounter a nest of the humanoid creatures hanging from the ceiling and try to sneak by, but the sound of Haversham's oxygen alarm wakes the creatures. Price is partially swallowed by one of the creatures but is able to kill it and free herself.

The three manage to reach the escape pod bay, but Price discovers that only two of the pods are functional. Price and Haversham manage to get the ailing Smith into a pod, and Price persuades Haversham to take the last one.

As this happens, a gigantic creature emerges and attacks the Roebuck, while the smaller creatures follow the two escape pods. Price, accepting her impending death, initiates an overload of Roebuck's nuclear core, resulting in a massive explosion that kills the creatures and allows the escape pods to reach the surface. This is followed by news headlines that say there were only two survivors, suggesting none of the other escape pods made it. Tian Industries refuses to be involved with investigations into the events and prepares to expand its drilling efforts.

",,"Given the detailed plot summary, here's the analysis for ""Underwater"":

### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Gender Based Violence**: The movie does involve some physical violence and stress on the female characters, including the protagonist Norah Price, but it is not explicitly gender-based. The violence and physical threats are more related to survival rather than being inflicted specifically because of their gender.
2. **Other**: The major themes appear to revolve around survival, facing the unknown, and sacrifice rather than being explicitly tied to the categories of womanhood listed (motherhood, gender-based violence, female sexuality, beauty, perfection, or aging).

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
- **Professional related to caretaking**: Although Norah Price's role as a mechanical engineer does not neatly fit into the traditional female roles, her actions in the story—risking her life to save her colleagues and ultimately sacrificing herself—align closely with the theme of caretaking and protection.

### Portrayal as a Monster:
- **Other**: Norah Price is portrayed as a hero and a survivalist, not a monster in any sense related to Barbara Creed's concept of the Monstrous-Feminine.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?
- **Dies**: Norah Price initiates the reactor overload and sacrifices herself to ensure the escape of her remaining colleagues.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment:
- **Empowerment**: Norah Price demonstrates agency, resolve, and significant courage throughout the movie. She decides to take control of the situation and ultimately makes a heroic sacrifice. This paints her as an empowered character who actively shapes her own fate rather than being a passive victim.",5,5,2,2,1,1
Lights Out,2016,David F. Sandberg,M,Teresa Palmer,F,"When Rebecca left home, she thought she left her childhood fears behind. Growing up, she was never really sure of what was and wasn’t real when the lights went out…and now her little brother, Martin, is experiencing the same unexplained and terrifying events that had once tested her sanity and threatened her safety. A frightening entity with a mysterious attachment to their mother, Sophie, has reemerged.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_Out_(2016_film),"In a textile factory during closing hours, after an employee named Esther says goodbye to her boss Paul, she encounters a silhouette of a strange woman with claw-like hands when the lights are off, but she cannot see it when the lights are on. After she leaves, Paul encounters the woman as well. As he tries to run away, he locks himself into an office, but is killed after the lights go out.

Some time later Paul's son, Martin, witnesses his mother, Sophie, talking to something in the dark. Sophie notices Martin and comforts him about the event, but as Martin goes back to bed he notices a strange figure in the shadow behind Sophie, and locks himself in his bedroom out of fear. Shortly thereafter Martin begins to have trouble staying awake at school. The nurse is unable to get in touch with Sophie to inform her of this, so Paul's stepdaughter (Martin's older half-sibling) Rebecca is called into the school nurse's office instead. A Child Protective Services agent questions Rebecca about Martin's living conditions, and Rebecca tells the official that Sophie is taking antidepressants.

Martin tells his sister that their mother has been talking to a woman named ""Diana"". Rebecca assures him that Diana is not real, and that she had also heard their mother talk to the imaginary girl when she was a child. Once they arrive at Martin's house, Rebecca gets into an argument with Sophie when she realizes her mother is not taking her medication. Sophie tells Rebecca she has no right to lecture her since she also abandoned her like Rebecca's father. Questioning her mother's sanity, Rebecca takes Martin to her apartment, much to Sophie's despair. That night, Rebecca is awoken by the same shadowed woman that killed Paul. She narrowly escapes an attack when she turns the lights on, making the woman disappear. The next morning, Rebecca notices that the name ""Diana"" has been scratched into her floor, along with a scratch drawing of a stick figure. She remembers finding the same name and drawing as a child and realizes Diana is real.

Rebecca finds a box of medical records and research in Paul's office. His findings reveal that her mother was admitted to a mental hospital as a child. While there, she befriended a young patient named Diana. Diana suffered from a severe skin condition that meant she could not go out in sunlight. It was believed that she was evil and was able to ""get into people's heads"" since Diana's father committed suicide after Diana influenced him to kill himself. In the end, Diana was accidentally reduced to ashes by the hospital staff when they tried to perform an experimental treatment on her under intense light. Sophie has a conversation with Martin, who was taken back to their mother by the CPS agent, and she decides to allow Martin to meet Diana after turning the light off. However, Martin is frightened by Diana and runs away from them back to Rebecca's place.

Rebecca, her boyfriend Bret, and Martin stage an intervention with Sophie about how their mother is letting Diana haunt them. Sophie becomes irate but secretly asks Rebecca for help, as Diana will not let Sophie go. The group stays the night at Sophie's, intending to get her help in the morning. To avoid an attack from Diana during the night, they rig the house to be as brightly lit as possible, but this proves useless when Diana cuts the power of the whole neighborhood. She traps Rebecca and Martin in the basement and attempts to kill Bret. Despite being injured, Bret escapes by shining the headlight of his car and drives away. In the basement, Martin and Rebecca find a black-light; when Rebecca is using it, she clearly sees Diana with it, but realizes it is not powerful enough to ward her off.

Bret returns with two police officers. When the officers free Martin and Rebecca from the basement, they also see the shadow of Diana and try to go after her, but she kills them. Rebecca and Martin go out, but Martin insists on getting Sophie out as well. Rebecca goes back alone for her mother. As she climbs the stairs, Diana tells Rebecca that she killed Rebecca's father years ago, because, like Paul, he tried to help Sophie recover from her trauma. She then injures Rebecca for trying to do the same, but as Diana prepares to kill her, Sophie appears with a gun from one of the dead officers and shoots at Diana, but Diana says that can’t harm her, to which Sophie replies “I know”. Sophie has realized she is the tether for Diana to exist in the real world and kills herself to save Rebecca and Martin. As Sophie's body falls, Diana vanishes from existence.

After the long night, Bret comforts Martin and Rebecca in an ambulance outside the house; a light flickers inside the ambulance but Bret assures them that Diana is truly gone.

Alien Resurrection,1997,Jean-Pierre Jeunet,M,Sigourney Weaver,F,"Two hundred years after Lt. Ripley died, a group of scientists clone her, hoping to breed the ultimate weapon. But the new Ripley is full of surprises … as are the new aliens. Ripley must team with a band of smugglers to keep the creatures from reaching Earth.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_Resurrection,"Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3, military scientists on the space vessel USM Auriga create a clone of Ellen Ripley, designated Ripley 8, using DNA from blood samples taken before her death. The Xenomorph queen's DNA has been combined with Ripley's, so the clone grows up with an embryo inside it. The scientists extract the embryo, raise it, and collect its eggs while keeping Ripley 8 alive for further study. As a result of the Xenomorphs' DNA inside her, the clone has enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and a psychic link with the Xenomorphs. Additionally, the Xenomorph's genetic memory allows the clone to have some of Ripley's memories.

A group of mercenaries consisting of Elgyn, Johner, Christie, Vriess, Hillard, and Call arrives at Auriga on their ship Betty and deliver several abducted humans in stasis. The military scientists use the humans as hosts for the aliens, raising several adult Xenomorphs for study.

The Betty crew soon encounters Ripley 8. Annalee Call recognizes her name and tries to kill her, suspecting that Ripley 8 may be used to create Xenomorphs, but the creatures have already been cloned. The mature Xenomorphs escape confinement by killing off one of their own to use its acidic blood to burn through their enclosures and capture Dr. Jonathan Gediman. They damage the Auriga and kill the majority of the crew who failed to evacuate, including General Perez and Elgyn. Military scientist Dr. Wren reveals that the ship's default command in an emergency is to return to Earth. Realizing that this will unleash the Xenomorphs on Earth, Ripley 8, the mercenaries, Wren, a soldier named DiStephano, and surviving Xenomorph host Purvis decide to head for the Betty and use it to destroy the Auriga. Along the way, Ripley 8 discovers a laboratory containing the grotesque results of the previous seven failed attempts to clone Ellen Ripley. A surviving one begs Ripley 8 to euthanize her; she complies and then incinerates the lab.

As the group makes their way through the damaged ship, they swim through a flooded kitchen. They are chased by two Xenomorphs. One is killed, while the other snatches Hillard. As they escape the kitchen, the Xenomorph returns and blinds Christie, who sacrifices himself to kill the Xenomorph. After Wren betrays the group, Call is revealed to be an android. Using her ability to interface with the Auriga's systems, Call sets it on a collision course with Earth, hoping to destroy the Xenomorphs in the crash. She cuts off Wren's escape route and directs the Xenomorphs toward him. Ripley 8 is captured by a Xenomorph, while the others head for the Betty. Wren, who is already aboard, shoots Purvis, takes Call hostage, and demands that she abort the collision. An injured Purvis attacks Wren and forces Wren's head to his chest as the Xenomorph embryo he is carrying bursts through his ribcage, killing them both. The survivors shoot and kill the juvenile Xenomorph.

Ripley is taken to the Alien nest, where she finds Gediman, alive and partially cocooned. The Alien queen, having developed a uterus as a result of her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a Xenomorph with overtly human traits. Unable to bond with the queen, the hybrid Xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as its mother, so it kills the Alien queen and Gediman. Ripley 8 takes advantage of the distraction to escape and makes her way to the Betty.

The newborn hybrid reaches the ship and attacks Call, killing DiStephano when he tries to help her. Ripley 8 finds her way onto the ship and saves Call by distracting the hybrid. Using her acidic blood, Ripley 8 melts a hole in a window and pushes the hybrid towards it. The decompression violently blows the creature through the hole and out into space as Ripley 8 tearfully watches on.

The countdown on the Auriga continues as Ripley 8, Call, Johner, and Vriess escape in the Betty. The Auriga collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. As they look down at Earth, Call asks what Ripley 8 wants to do next. ""I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself,"" she replies.

Just as relations begin to thaw between the trio, some strange and frightening events take place.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lodge_(film),"Laura Hall takes her own life after her estranged husband Richard informs her he plans to marry Grace Marshall, a woman he met while researching a book about an extremist cult. Raised in the cult, Grace was the sole survivor of their mass suicide, led by her father. Laura's death devastates her and Richard's children, teenage Aiden and young Mia.

Six months later, Richard announces that they will spend Christmas with Grace at the family's remote Massachusetts lodge to get to know each other. Aiden and Mia uncover Grace's past, including video footage of the cult, showing the deceased followers draped in purple silk with duct tape across their mouths reading ""sin."" At the lodge, the children act hostile toward Grace and refuse efforts to bond with her, even after Richard departs back to the city for a work obligation. Grace's unease is compounded by the abundance of Catholic iconography (including a reproduction of the Virgin Annunciate by Antonello da Messina) in the cabin, which causes her to have nightmares about her father. After being rebuked for watching her shower, Aiden prepares Grace a cup of cocoa and the group watches a movie; during which the siblings decide to use a gas heater indoors and Grace wonders whether it is safe.

In the morning, Grace awakens to discover that her belongings – including her clothing, psychiatric medication, and pet dog – are missing, as well as all the food and Christmas decorations. The generator has gone out, leaving all of their cell phones dead. Grace suspects the children have pranked her but finds their belongings missing as well. She notices the clocks have advanced to January 9th. Aiden tells Grace he dreamed the gas heater malfunctioned and they all suffocated and expresses fear that they may be in the afterlife.

Over the next several days, Grace succumbs to anxiety, medication withdrawal, hunger, and cold. She begins sleepwalking and is tormented by disturbing visions and dreams, including the recurrent voice of her father sermonizing. She attempts to walk to the nearest town, discovering a cross-shaped cabin where she sees her father beckoning to her. She eventually travels in a circle, taking her back to the lodge. Buried in the snow, she discovers a photo of Aiden and Mia in a memorial frame, and inside, finds the children praying over a newspaper article detailing the deaths of all three from carbon monoxide poisoning on December 22, 2019. Aiden insists they are in purgatory, and hangs himself in the attic as proof that they are dead, only to inexplicably survive.

Grace suffers a nervous breakdown, which intensifies when she finds her dog frozen to death outside. She enters a catatonic state on the porch. Worried she might die of exposure, the children finally admit that they have been gaslighting her the entire time, having drugged her, hidden their possessions in a crawlspace, faked the hanging, and played recordings of her father's sermons via a wireless speaker. With their own phones dead at last, the children unsuccessfully attempt to start the generator and bring Grace her medication, but find her convinced that they are in purgatory and must do penance to be accepted by God and ascend to heaven.

That night, the children witness Grace self-flagellating by burning herself on the hearth. They hide in the attic but Grace confronts them in the morning, insisting they must ""sacrifice something for the Lord"" and ""free themselves from idols"" before setting Mia's doll on fire. Richard returns to discover an inconsolable Grace holding his revolver. In an attempt to prove her belief that they are in purgatory, she first fires the gun at herself, however no bullet is fired. Convinced its a sign of her incapacity of dying for being in the afterlife, she turns the gun and opens fire at Richard, shooting him in the head and killing him. Aiden and Mia attempt to flee in the car, but get stuck in the snow. Grace forces the children back into the lodge, where she seats them at the dinner table with their father's corpse and sings Nearer, My God, to Thee. She affixes duct tape reading ""sin"" over each of their mouths while a loaded gun rests on the table.

1. **Motherhood:** The theme of motherhood is present given Laura's tragic suicide, triggered by Richard's intention to remarry. This significantly impacts her children, showing the profound effect of a mother's death on her family.
2. **Gender-based violence:** While not explicitly framed within the narrative of physical assault, Grace's psychological torment exemplifies an extreme form of emotional abuse and manipulation. The children's actions subject Grace to trauma, which can be viewed through the lens of gender-based violence.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
5. **Other:** Grace is not framed within traditional female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. Instead, her character is more complex, as she transitions from a vulnerable survivor with a traumatic past to a mentally unhinged figure driven to extreme actions due to continued psychological manipulation.

**Monstrous Feminine:**
1. **Monstrous feminine:** Grace embodies the ""possessed body"" and ""monstrous mother"" aspects. Her breakdown and subsequent belief in being in purgatory, along with her extreme actions towards Richard and his children, align with Barbara Creed’s concept of the Monstrous-Feminine.

At an empty park, she solves the puzzle but misses being cut by the blade. The Cenobites, a group of mutilated humanoids, appear and demand another sacrifice. Matt, feeling guilty about his strained relationship with Riley, finds her incapacitated and inadvertently cuts himself on the box while attempting to awaken her. He enters a nearby restroom to clean his wound but then experiences a headache. Outside, Riley notices the box changing shapes before she hears Matt screaming, finding him missing upon entering the bathroom.

Believing the box caused Matt's disappearance, Riley and Trevor track down Voight's former lawyer Serena Menaker at an assisted living facility. Having concealed it in the warehouse, Menaker attempts to confiscate the box from Riley but is cut by the blade and later abducted by the Cenobites. Visiting Voight's abandoned mansion, Riley discovers from his journals that each of the box's 6 configurations require a victim to be marked for sacrifice by its blade. On completion, the holder receives a ""gift"" from Leviathan, the entity that rules over Hell. Riley sees an apparition of Matt and is horrified to discover he has been flayed.

Colin, Trevor and Nora arrive in Trevor's van to take Riley home. While Riley explains her findings to Colin, Nora hits a switch in the bar that opens a secret passage. Trevor inadvertently shuts the door, trapping her inside the passage, and as he attempts to rescue her, the mutilated Voight, concealed inside the walls, stabs her with the box. The group escapes the mansion to seek help, but the Cenobites abduct Nora, who is taunted, tortured, and fatally flayed in a decrepit hallway by their leader, the Priest. The van crashes after Riley sees a reflection of Nora's torture in the rearview mirror, whereupon the Priest appears. After Riley refuses the Priest's offer to exchange Matt for two sacrifices, she is ordered to sacrifice either two people or herself. After a Cenobite known as the Chatterer injures Trevor, Riley solves the next configuration and stabs the Chatterer, who is ripped apart as the next sacrifice.

The trio retreats to the mansion, realizing the steel doors will bar the Cenobites from entering. Leaving Trevor to rest, Riley and Colin plan to trap a Cenobite known as the Asphyx as the last sacrifice, but she drops the box. Voight appears, picks it up, and stabs Colin, revealing that he sought ""sensation"" after completing all of his sacrifices, but instead, a contraption was attached to him that randomly twists his nerve endings. He privately speaks with Trevor, revealing he employed him to locate suitable humans, then completes the final configuration and traps the Cenobites, demanding they ask Leviathan to free him. While Leviathan appears above the mansion, Riley retrieves the box, unlocks the steel doors, and rescues Colin from torture by stabbing Trevor, marking him as the final sacrifice. Meanwhile, the Priest warns Voight that his reward can only be exchanged and not revoked; he accepts her offer of ""power"" and is released from his contraption and healed, only for Leviathan to immediately impale him with a large chain and lift him away.

With the sacrifices completed, the Cenobites offer to resurrect Matt. Riley declines, realizing their gifts will bring pain, and decides to accept Matt's death. After the Cenobites praise her for choosing the Lament Configuration, a life of regret with bitter and brief suffering, they vanish and the box resumes its cube configuration. As the duo leaves the mansion, Colin asks a silent Riley if her choice was justified; meanwhile, inside Leviathan's realm, Voight is brutally transformed into a new Cenobite.

Un Chien Andalou,1929,Luis Buñuel,M,Simone Mareuil,F,Un Chien Andalou is a classic European avant-garde surrealist film from the cooperation of director Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dali. The film changed the way people made movies. Most famous is the scene of a woman’s eye being cut with a knife.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_Chien_Andalou,"The film opens with a title card reading ""Once upon a time"". A man (Luis Buñuel) sharpens his razor at his balcony door and tests the razor on his thumb. He then opens the door, and idly fingers the razor while gazing at the Moon, about to be bisected by a thin cloud, from his balcony. There is a cut to a close-up of a young woman (Simone Mareuil) being held by the man. She calmly stares straight ahead as he brings the razor near her eye. Another cut occurs to the cloud passing in front of the Moon, then a cut to a close up of a hand slitting the eye of an animal with the razor (which happens so quickly the viewer may believe it was the woman's eye), and the vitreous humour spills out from it.

The subsequent title card reads ""eight years later"". A slim young man (Pierre Batcheff) bicycles down a calm urban street wearing what appears to be a nun's habit and a striped box with a strap around his neck. A cut occurs to the young woman from the first scene, who has been reading in a sparsely furnished upstairs apartment. She hears the young man approaching on his bicycle and casts aside the book she was reading (revealing a reproduction of Vermeer's The Lacemaker). She goes to the window and sees the young man lying on the curb, his bicycle on the ground. She emerges from the building and attempts to revive the young man.

Later, the young woman assembles pieces of the young man's clothing on a bed in the upstairs room, and concentrates upon the clothing. The young man appears near the door. The young man and the young woman stare at his hand, which has a hole in the palm from which ants emerge. A slow transition occurs focusing on the armpit hair of the young woman as she lies on the beach and a sea urchin at a sandy location. There is a cut to an androgynous young woman, with bobbed hair and dressed in rather masculine attire, in the street below the apartment. She pokes at a severed human hand with her cane while surrounded by a large crowd held back by policemen.

The crowd clears when the policeman places the hand in the box previously carried by the young man and gives it to the young woman. The androgynous young woman contemplates something happily while standing in the middle of the now busy street clutching the box. She is then run over by a car and a few bystanders gather around her. The young man and the young woman watch these events unfold from the apartment window. The young man seems to take sadistic pleasure in the androgynous young woman's danger and subsequent death, and as he gestures at the shocked young woman in the room with him, he leers at her and gropes her breasts.

The young woman resists him at first, but then allows him to molest her as he imagines her nude from the front and the rear. The young woman pushes him away as he drifts off and she attempts to escape by running to the other side of the room. The young man corners her as she reaches for a racquet in self-defense, but he suddenly picks up two ropes and drags two grand pianos containing dead and rotting donkeys, stone tablets containing the Ten Commandments, two pumpkins, and two rather bewildered priests (played by Jaume Miravitlles and Salvador Dalí) who are attached by the ropes. As he is unable to pursue, the young woman escapes the room. The young man chases after her, but she traps his hand, which is infested with ants, in the door. She finds the young man in the next room, dressed in his nun's garb in the bed.

The subsequent title card reads ""around three in the morning"". The young man is roused from his rest by the sound of a door-buzzer ringing (represented visually by a Martini shaker being shaken by a set of arms through two holes in a wall). The young woman goes to answer the door and does not return. Another young man, whom we see only from behind, dressed in lighter clothing, arrives in the apartment, gesturing angrily at him. The second young man forces the first one to throw away his nun's clothing and then makes him stand with his face to the wall, as if in disgrace.

The subsequent title card reads ""Sixteen years ago"". We see the second young man's face for the first time (and discover that he is also played by Pierre Batcheff) as he admires the art supplies and books on the table near the wall and forces the first young man to hold two of the books as he stares at the wall. The first young man eventually shoots the second young man when the books abruptly turn into revolvers. The second young man, now in a meadow, dies while swiping at the back of a nude female figure which suddenly disappears into thin air. A group of men come and carry his corpse away.

The young woman returns to the apartment and sees a death's-head moth. The first young man sneers at her as she retreats and wipes his mouth off his face with his hand. The young woman very nervously applies some lipstick in response. Subsequently, the first young man makes the young woman's armpit hair attach itself to where his mouth would be on his face through gestures. The young woman looks at the first young man with disgust, and leaves the apartment sticking her tongue out at him.

As she exits her apartment, the street is replaced by a coastal beach, where the young woman meets a third man with whom she walks arm in arm. He shows her the time on his watch and they walk near the rocks, where they find the remnants of the first young man's nun's clothing and the box. They seem to walk away clutching each other happily and make romantic gestures in a long tracking shot. However, the film abruptly cuts to the final shot with a title card reading ""In Spring"", showing the couple buried in beach sand up to their elbows, motionless and perhaps dead.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood
Based on the plot summary provided, it is difficult to definitively identify themes related to womanhood without further thematic analysis or interpretation. However, we can consider the following possible themes:
1. **Gender-based violence**: The young woman in the film is subjected to physical assault and violation of her autonomy, particularly in scenes involving the man groping and molesting her.
2. **Female sexuality**: There are elements related to sexual violence and the objectification of the female body, such as when the man imagines her nude.

### Traditional Female Roles
1. **Adolescent girl**: Although the specific age of the female protagonist is not mentioned, she exhibits vulnerability and a sense of naivety that align with the traditional role of an adolescent girl.
2. **Other**: The plot does not clearly place her in a traditional female role such as mother, housewife, professional related to beauty, or caretaking. Her role is more of a general symbolic or surreal character caught in the bizarre and unsettling narrative.

### Main Protagonist Portrayed as Monster
1. **Other**: The female protagonist is not portrayed as a monster in the traditional sense of the ""monstrous-feminine"" described by Barbara Creed. Instead, she appears to be more of a victim or passive participant in the surreal events of the film.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?
1. **Unclear/No definitive ending**: The ending is ambiguous. The final shot suggests that the couple might be dead, but this is open to interpretation.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment?
1. **Victimization**: The young woman experiences physical and psychological torment without evident agency or autonomy. She is subjected to the whims of the men around her and is primarily portrayed as a victim throughout the film.

Given these assessments, ""Un Chien Andalou"" aligns more closely with themes of gender-based violence and presents its female protagonist in contexts of victimization and vulnerability. The surreal nature of the film complicates definitive thematic analysis, but it largely showcases the helplessness and objectification of the female character.",2,5,2,1,1,1
Velvet Buzzsaw,2019,Dan Gilroy,M,Rene Russo,F,"Big money artists and mega-collectors pay a high price when art collides with commerce. After a series of paintings by an unknown artist are discovered, a supernatural force enacts revenge on those who have allowed their greed to get in the way of art.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Buzzsaw,"In Miami, art critic Morf Vandewalt (Jake Gyllenhaal) attends an art exhibition alongside his friend Josephina (Zawe Ashton), who works for Rhodora Haze (Rene Russo), owner of the Haze Gallery and formerly a member of the punk rock band Velvet Buzzsaw. Unfulfilled in his love life with his boyfriend Ed, Morf starts a sexual relationship with Josephina.

Returning to Los Angeles, Josephina finds a dead man named Vetril Dease in her apartment building and enters his home to discover a myriad of paintings, some of which are partially destroyed. Josephina steals the paintings to show Morf and Rhodora, who become fascinated with Dease. Rhodora decides to exhibit several of his pieces in her gallery to great success. The artworks also enchant Gretchen (Toni Collette), Morf's art curator friend, Piers (John Malkovich), a former artist for the Haze Gallery, and Damrish (Daveed Diggs), an up-and-coming artist.

To ensure the rarity of the paintings, Rhodora orders gallery worker Bryson to transport half of them to storage. En route, a painting catches fire from his cigarette ash and burns him, causing him to crash into a seemingly abandoned gas station. After he heads inside to clean the burns, Bryson is dragged into a painting by a group of monkey mechanics. Outside, his truck catches fire and burns the remaining Dease paintings.

Researching Dease, Morf discovers he suffered from an abusive childhood that culminated in the murder of his father, after which he was sent to a psychiatric hospital for human experimentation, adding to his mental illness. Jon Dondon, a rival art gallery owner, hires a private investigator to uncover the same story. He attempts to reveal Dease's story to the press but is murdered when a mysterious hand hangs him by his scarf. Coco (Natalia Dyer), Rhodora's former assistant who had just begun working for Jon, discovers his body.

Morf sees a hand in a Dease painting suddenly move; his vision is cleared by his optometrist but he continues to hallucinate. That night, he visits the gallery archivist and learns Dease used blood to make his red-black paints. Rhodora, disappointed with Piers' most recent work, sends him to live at her beach house and not return until he has made art only for himself.

Gretchen negotiates the display of some Dease paintings in the city's museum alongside an interactive piece titled Sphere, which is owned by Gretchen's primary client. Meanwhile, Gretchen also sabotages Josephina's relationship with Morf by telling her he still has feelings for Ed. The night before the exhibit's debut, Gretchen sticks her arm in one of the holes in Sphere which malfunctions and severs her arm, leaving her to bleed out. Coco, who had recently become Gretchen's assistant, finds her body the next morning. Despite, or perhaps because of, Gretchen's death, there is a spike in interest and demand for the Dease exhibit. Morf and Josephina break up after he finds out she is dating Damrish.

Morf's visions worsen, and he urges Rhodora to stop selling Dease's artwork. She ignores him and, knowing he will write a negative article about the artworks, tries to sell them off as fast as she can for tens of millions of dollars. Morf hires the again unemployed Coco to dispose of the artworks. At a dive bar, Damrish informs Josephina he will not display his art with Haze Gallery, and they break up. Outside, Josephina is mysteriously transported to a gallery where the graffiti paintings melt around her and envelop her skin. As Morf puts the Dease artworks into his storage unit, he discovers a deactivated Hoboman, a robotic art piece he had given a negative critique. Hoboman springs to life and chases Morf into a dead end where it breaks Morf's neck, despite Morf's pleas for mercy.

The next morning, Coco finds Morf's body while Josephina's terrified image is seen on a wall of graffiti. Rhodora, now believing the deaths are connected to Dease, has all the artwork in her house removed. As she sits outside her house, the buzz saw tattoo on her neck begins spinning and slashes her flesh, killing her. On the way to LAX, returning home to Michigan, Coco passes a street vendor selling Dease's paintings for five dollars apiece, having found one of the boxes from Bryson's truck. Meanwhile, Piers draws a pattern of curves on the beach sand as the waves wash over them.",,"**Themes Related to Womanhood:**

Her older brother Mathew later sets up cameras around the family home to capture what appears to be footage of Alice's ghost. Mathew and his parents Russell and June consult self-proclaimed psychic Ray for insight on the apparent haunting, but he is unable to explain it; Mathew confesses he set up the ""sightings"" of Alice as he wanted the family to have a reason to exhume her, thus giving closure to June, who regrets refusing to see Alice's body before the funeral. One of his videos shows Alice's bedroom being searched by Brett, a neighbour for whom she had worked as a babysitter. After searching the bedroom, June finds a hidden videotape of Alice having a threesome with Brett and his wife Marissa.

Ray admits that Alice had met with him several months before her death and told him she was experiencing recurring dreams about drowning, being dead, and her mother being unable to see or help her. Alice's boyfriend Jason gives her family mobile phone footage of a school trip to Lake Mungo, which shows Alice burying something at the base of a tree. They travel to Lake Mungo, find the tree, and dig up her phone.

Wendell & Wild,2022,Henry Selick,M,Lyric Ross,F,Two demon brothers enlist the aid of Kat Elliot — a tough teen with a load of guilt — to summon them to the Land of the Living. But what Kat demands in return leads to a brilliantly bizarre and comedic adventure like no other.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendell_%26_Wild,"Eight year old Katherine ""Kat"" Koniqua Elliot lives with her parents Delroy and Wilma, who own a root beer brewery in the town of Rust Bank. Driving home on a stormy night from a library fundraiser at the brewery, Kat is frightened by a two-headed worm in her candy apple, leading her father to veer off a bridge; only Kat survives after her mother sacrifices her life to save her. Meanwhile, in the underworld, demon brothers Wendell and Wild spend their days putting rejuvenating hair cream on their balding father, Buffalo Belzer, while dreaming of making an amusement park, the Dream Fair, for departed souls to challenge Belzer's ""Scream Fair"". Wild continuously steals the hair cream by eating it for its hallucinogenic effect, much to Wendell's annoyance, but Wild manages to change Wendell's mind by force-feeding him the cream. The hallucinogenic effect kicks in, and the brothers have a vision of Kat.

Five years later, Kat is an embittered, punk rock-loving thirteen year old juvenile delinquent who blames herself for her parents' deaths. Kat is enrolled in Rust Bank's all-girls Catholic school, headed by Father Bests. A trio of preppy classmates attempt to befriend Kat. The group is led by Siobhan Klaxon, whose parents Lane and Irmgard's private prison company Klaxon ""Klax"" Korp has taken over the town. Kat unintentionally endears herself to Siobhan by saving her from a falling brick, which she anticipated through premonition, a power that shocks her. Later, she meets Raúl Cocolotl, a trans boy who was once friends with Siobhan and the one who accidentally broke the brick that nearly landed on the latter’s head. Raúl's mother, Marianna, is convinced the Klaxons are the reason the brewery burned down and caused it to kill all of its workers. During a class taught by Sister Helley, Kat receives a marking on her hand resembling a skull when she approached Helley's desk, which Helley tells her she must hide and tell no one. The mark alerts Wendell and Wild from a possessed stuffed-bear called Bearzebub, identifying Kat as their ""hell maiden"", and they appear to her in a dream and make an empty promise to revive her parents (though demons can't resurrect the dead), if she summons them to the world of the living.

Kat steals Bearzebub from Helley's desk so she can use it to summon Wendell and Wild. Helley, once a hell maiden herself, works with the school's janitor and secret demon hunter, Manberg, who hunts demons and keeps them in jars. Father Bests is revealed to be in league with the Klaxons, who kill him as the last witness to their factory fire. After his funeral, Kat recruits Raúl as her witness to summon the demon brothers, who brought their father's hair cream with them after they discovered that it can bring dead organisms back to life. However, by the taking the wrong way, the brothers appear in a different part of the cemetery, and Kat believes she has been stood up.

Wendell and Wild test the cream on Bests, who comes back to life and convinces the Klaxons to pay the brothers to revive the deceased members of the town council, which will give the Klaxons the votes they need to demolish Rust Bank and expand their prisons. Though the Klaxons fear they could resurrect other people in the cemetery, such as the brew workers that died in the fire, and other witnesses to the brewery arson, they tell Wendell and Wild that if they revive Kat's parents or any other dead people, they won't pay for their fair or for the school. Bests returns to school, and Kat confronts the brothers, who make her vow to serve them forever in exchange for her parents' resurrection but it is just a ruse to make sure that they won’t resurrect anyone in the cemetery. Forced to dig up the council members, whom Wendell and Wild revive, Raúl steals the cream and revives Delroy and Wilma himself. Reunited with her parents, Kat helps Raúl escape the brothers.

After the zombie council approves the Klaxons' plans and pay Bests, Wendell, and Wild with a bag full of money, Siobhan discovers her parents' lies about the conditions of their prisons. Helley and Manberg make Kat undergo a ritual called soul binding, confronting her memories and severing her allegiance with Wendell and Wild, resulting in her accepting the fact that her parents' death was not her fault. The soul binding ritual further gives Kat the control of her precognitive powers, which Helley reveals are a consequence of her status as a hell maiden. After learning of their resurrection, Bests, Wendell, and Wild kidnap Delroy and Wilma and take them to the cemetery to kill them until Kat, Raúl, Helley, and Manberg stop them, where Siobhan, who followed her pet pygmy goat Gabby Goat to the cemetery, reveals that her parents paid Bests, Wendell, and Wild worthless company money. Buffalo Belzer appears, having discovered Wendell and Wild's deception, but a mural painted by Raúl as his art project, depicting his mother Marianna, as a mighty Mayan warrior, defending and protecting a baby Raúl against a two-headed dragon (representing the Klaxons) painted part-by-part on every house's roof in Rust Bank, convinces him to make up with his sons. Manberg releases his collection of jarred demons after learning they are Belzer's children in exchange for Kat and the others. Belzer apologizes to Wendell and Wild, approving their plans for their Dream Fair. Bests dies again, and Belzer explains that the cream's effects “don’t last.”

Kat says it's too late to save Rust Bank, but Sister Helley tells her that her power to see into the future can help her change it. Recalling that Raúl said there needs to be a witness to prove the Klaxons are guilty, Kat tells him to use the very last bit of cream to revive as many dead brew workers as he can. The group fends off the bulldozers conducted by the zombie council set to demolish the town while Raúl revives three dead factory workers to testify to the Klaxons' crimes, resulting in their arrest. The cream's effect begin to wear off on Delroy and Wilma, but before they die, Kat uses her precognition to give them a glimpse of the future where Rust Bank is revived, and Wendell and Wild offer them VIP passes to their afterlife fair. Kat makes peace with her life, considering everyone her friends, even Wendell and Wild themselves.

The Watchers,2024,Ishana Night Shyamalan,F,Dakota Fanning,F,"A young artist gets stranded in an extensive, immaculate forest in western Ireland, where, after finding shelter, she becomes trapped alongside three strangers, stalked by mysterious creatures each night.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watchers_(film),"Mina, an American immigrant working in a pet shop in Galway, Ireland, struggles to come to terms with the death of her mother, which she inadvertently caused fifteen years earlier, and is estranged from her twin sister Lucy. Mina's boss tasks her with delivering a valuable golden conure parrot to a zoo near Belfast. En route, her car breaks down, stranding her in a forest. Lost, she names the parrot Darwin. She follows an old woman, Madeline, to a bunker-like building, nicknamed ""The Coop"", and meets two other occupants, Ciara and Daniel. Madeline explains that mysterious entities called ""The Watchers"" observe the group through the mirrored window of the Coop every night.

Madeline explains the rules to Mina: at night the Watchers kill anyone outside the Coop, and nobody must enter the Burrows, the underground tunnels where the Watchers retreat during the day because of their aversion to sunlight. The group has been stranded in the forest for several months without encountering a Watcher; Ciara's husband John left the Coop days earlier but has not returned. Daniel helps Mina explore a Burrow, where she unearths several items like a camcorder and a bicycle and narrowly escapes a Watcher. That night, John appears at the Coop but Madeline refuses to let him in. When ""John"" fails to verify himself to Ciara, he appears to be dragged away. The Watchers crack the mirror; Madeline returns the items to the Burrow to appease them.

As winter falls, the group begins to turn hostile against one another. Daniel locks Mina and Madeline out of the Coop one night, forcing them to seek shelter in the forest. They witness the Watchers, humanoid creatures that imitate the Coop's occupants and react angrily to Madeline and Mina's absence. The pair get back into the Coop and Madeline explains that the Watchers are shapeshifting fairies attempting to learn how to better mimic humans. The Watchers attack the Coop. The group escapes through a hidden door leading to an underground study. Mina uncovers video diaries of Professor Rory Kilmartin, the Coop's creator. Kilmartin had come to the forest to study the creatures and had even captured one of them and bonded with it. In his last entry, the despondent professor explains how to escape from the forest and requests that his research be destroyed. The video ends with his climbing back into the Coop to kill the captured Watcher and himself.

The next day, the group follows the professor's directions and uses Darwin to guide them to the river at the edge of the forest. On the way, Madeline shows them a stone marker, explaining that humans had warred against the Fairies, who were deprived of their wings, driven underground, and imprisoned in the forest. Upon reaching the professor's boat, a Watcher mimicking John kills Daniel. The others take the boat and finally arrive back to civilization. On the road, a bus stops for them, and the driver says he can take them to the next city.

Mina heads to the professor's university to destroy his notes. There, she learns that humans and fairies once lived in harmony, with some even mating and producing hybrid offspring that could withstand daylight. She visits Ciara and shows her photographs, revealing that Madeline had been the professor's late wife. Their ""Madeline"" is the Watcher that the professor captured.

Ciara is revealed to be a disguised Madeline when the real Ciara arrives at the house. Madeline changes her form, knocking out Ciara and attacking Mina. She recounts that she was an outcast among the Watchers for her ability to walk during the day and plans to kill and replace Mina. Mina reveals Madeline's status as a half-human hybrid, persuading her to let go of her hatred towards humans, and telling her that there may be others like her out there. Madeline sprouts wings and departs.

Later, Mina reconciles with her sister Lucy. Meanwhile, Madeline, in the form of a human child, keeps watch over Mina.",,"### Themes related to womanhood:

Jeepers Creepers,2001,Victor Salva,M,Gina Philips,F,A brother and sister driving home through an isolated countryside from college encounter a flesh-eating creature in the midst of its ritualistic eating spree.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeepers_Creepers_(2001_film),"Trish Jenner and her brother Darry are traveling home from college for spring break. As they drive through the Florida countryside, an old truck violently tailgates them but eventually passes. During their drive, they discuss an urban legend of the road they are currently traveling, of a prom couple who disappeared. Their vehicle was recovered without the head of the prom girl, Darla. They later stumble on the same truck parked next to an abandoned church with the driver dumping what appears to be bodies wrapped in blood-stained sheets into a large pipe sticking out of the ground. The driver then notices them, giving chase and forcing them off the road.

With the driver gone, Darry convinces Trish to return to the church. Upon investigation, Darry hears strange noises emanating from the pipe and crawls inside with Trish holding onto his feet. Trish accidentally drops Darry, who falls to the bottom and into the church basement. He finds a dying young man with stitches running down his stomach and numerous corpses sewn to the walls and ceiling, including those of a missing prom couple from twenty-three years ago with Darla's head sewn back on. Darry locates an exit, and he and Trish flee the scene to seek help at a nearby diner. However, they receive a cryptic warning call from a mysterious woman who predicts their imminent danger, mentioning a future encounter with a cat lady and playing the song ""Jeepers Creepers"", suggesting that one of them will meet a terrifying fate while hearing it. Darry, angry and terrified of the woman's warnings, calls the police who do not believe him. While talking to the police, the truck driver broke into their car and the waitress who witnessed the break-in testified he sniffed their laundry and looked like he ""really liked it.""

The police escorts them back to the church, but learns it has been set on fire, destroying any potential evidence, and is brutally attacked and killed by the truck driver, leaving Trish and Darry in shock as they witness the carnage. Seeking refuge, they stop at the home of an elderly woman with numerous cats in an attempt to call the police. The driver, hiding in her yard, kills her and reveals its monstrous appearance to Trish and Darry. Trish repeatedly runs the driver over with her car, but she and Darry are left horrified as a giant wing tears through its trench coat. They drive off.

They eventually reach a police station where they meet Jezelle Gay Hartman, the psychic who called them at the diner. She reveals the true nature of their pursuer: an ancient creature called ""the Creeper,"" which emerges every 23rd spring for twenty-three days to feed on human body parts, incorporating them into its own body. Jezelle warns them that the Creeper hunts its victims through fear, and by smelling the fear from Trish and Darry, it has found something it likes.

The wounded Creeper arrives at the police station, causing chaos as it consumes prisoners to heal itself. Despite efforts to capture it by police, the Creeper escapes, trapping Trish and Darry. Jezelle predicts that one of them is doomed to die horribly; Darry demands to know who, and Jezelle looks at Trish. The Creeper finds them but spares Jezelle before cornering Trish and Darry in an upstairs interrogation room. After sniffing them, the Creeper throws Trish aside and chooses Darry. Trish offers herself in exchange for her brother's life. The Creeper gives it some thought but ultimately flies away with him.

The next day, Trish is picked up by her parents, while Jezelle returns home regretfully. In an abandoned factory, it is revealed the Creeper has removed the back of Darry's head and taken his eyes, all while the song ""Jeepers Creepers"" plays in the background.

Crawl,2019,Alexandre Aja,M,Kaya Scodelario,F,"When a huge hurricane hits her hometown in Florida, Haley ignores evacuation orders to look for her father. After finding him badly wounded, both are trapped by the flood. With virtually no time to escape the storm, they discover that rising water levels are the least of their problems.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawl_(2019_film),"University of Florida swimmer Haley Keller receives a call from her sister Beth, who informs her that Category 5 Hurricane Wendy is on its way to Florida and advises her to get out of the state. Concerned for the safety of her estranged father Dave, Haley goes to check on him at his condo but finds it empty. She goes against the instructions of Beth's ex-boyfriend, Florida state trooper Wayne, by deciding to check out their old family home in Coral Lake, a location at risk of flooding.

Haley finds the house empty, so she descends into the house's crawl space with the help of the family dog, Sugar, and finds her father unconscious. Suddenly, her main exit is cut off by several large American alligators. As the house begins to flood, Haley attempts to navigate around them to retrieve her phone but is ambushed by two alligators that destroy the phone and injure her leg. She notices three people looting a nearby gas station, but, despite one of them spotting her signal, each of them is devoured by alligators as she watches in despair.

Wayne and his partner Pete arrive at the old house in search of Haley and her father. While Wayne heads into the house to look for them, Pete is ambushed and ripped apart by a swarm of alligators. Wayne locates them as they warn him of the dangers in the crawl space before being pulled into the crawl space and devoured underwater by an alligator. In a last-ditch effort to escape, Haley swims to a storm drain, where she discovers the alligators have made their nest and laid eggs.

Haley successfully kills an alligator with Wayne's gun by firing down its throat. She then swims out into the flooded street through the storm drain and enters the house to crowbar the living room floor open, saving Dave from drowning. Haley, Dave, and Sugar carefully make their way onto a boat outside as the eye of the hurricane moves over the neighborhood. The floodwaters break the nearby levees, crashing them back into the house.

As Dave and Sugar make their way up the stairs, Dave loses his right arm when he is attacked by an alligator. Haley navigates around the kitchen and uses a discarded police radio to broadcast a distress signal to authorities. She also manages to trap an alligator in the house bathroom and attempts to flag down a rescue helicopter from an upstairs bedroom. However, Haley is attacked by another alligator that tries to perform a death roll. While Dave and Sugar escape to the attic, Haley stabs the alligator in the eye with a flare and all three reunite on the roof. After narrowly avoiding another alligator, they rest for a brief moment on the roof. Dave gawks wide eyed past his daughter at something, to which she turns to look. A bright light shines down through the clouds, the beam emanating from a rescue helicopter dispatched as a result of the distress call Haley made earlier. Haley lights a flare and flags down the rescue helicopter, turning to gaze upon her father in triumph and relief as Dave proudly watches.

The Fog,1980,John Carpenter,M,Adrienne Barbeau,F,"Strange things begin to occurs as a tiny California coastal town prepares to commemorate its centenary. Inanimate objects spring eerily to life; Rev. Malone stumbles upon a dark secret about the town's founding; radio announcer Stevie witnesses a mystical fire; and hitchhiker Elizabeth discovers the mutilated corpse of a fisherman. Then a mysterious iridescent fog descends upon the village, and more people start to die.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fog,"On the eve of the centennial of the small coastal town Antonio Bay in Northern California, old Mr. Machen tells ghost stories to children by a campfire on the beach. One story is about a clipper ship that crashed against the rocks nearby, causing all of its crew to drown after mistaking a campfire for a lighthouse while sailing through an unearthly fog. Machen finishes the story as midnight strikes and paranormal activity begins occurring around the town. Town priest, Father Malone, discovers his grandfather's diary. The journal reveals that a century earlier, in 1880, the 6 founders of Antonio Bay (including Malone's grandfather) deliberately wrecked a clipper ship named the Elizabeth Dane, so that its wealthy, leprosy-afflicted owner Blake would not establish a leper colony nearby. The conspirators used the gold plundered from the ship to establish the town.

Meanwhile, out at sea, a strange, glowing fog envelops a fishermen's trawler. The fog brings with it the Elizabeth Dane, carrying the vengeful ghosts of Blake and his crew, who kill the fishermen. The following morning, local radio DJ Stevie Wayne is given a piece of driftwood by her son Andy, who found it on the beach. It is inscribed with the word ""DANE"". Stevie takes it with her to the lighthouse where she broadcasts her radio show. As she is listening to music on a cassette, the driftwood begins seeping water. As the water touches her cassette player, a man's voice is inexplicably heard on the tape, swearing revenge, and the words ""6 must die"" appear on the wood before it bursts into flames. Stevie extinguishes the fire and sees that the wood once again reads ""DANE"", and the tape is once again playing normally.

Town resident Nick and hitchhiker Elizabeth find the lost fishing trawler adrift and the corpse of one of the fishermen. Later, while Elizabeth is in the autopsy room alone, the fisherman's corpse briefly comes to life and accosts her before collapsing. Nick and coroner Dr. Phibes see the now-lifeless corpse has carved the number 3 on the floor with a scalpel. That evening, as the town begins its celebrations, local weatherman Dan is killed by the ghosts at the weather station. The fog has returned and starts moving inland, disrupting the town's telephone and power lines. Using a backup generator, Stevie begs her listeners to go to her house and save her son. The ghosts kill her son's babysitter but Nick and Elizabeth rescue Andy.

Stevie advises her listeners to head to the town's church, but then finds herself trapped and under siege by the ghosts when the fog envelops her lighthouse. Seeking refuge inside the church, a group of townsfolk finds a large gold cross in the wall cavity, made from the rest of the stolen gold from the Elizabeth Dane, just as the fog begins enveloping the church and the ghosts begin their attack. Malone, knowing that the ghosts have returned to take 6 lives instead of the 6 original conspirators, offers the gold and himself to spare the others. The ghost of Blake himself seizes the gold cross and he and his crew disappear in a blinding flash of light as the fog miraculously vanishes. Stevie, now alone again at the lighthouse, warns her listeners that the fog could come again and instructs any ships that can hear her to keep an eye out for it.

After everyone leaves the church, Malone remains inside and wonders why he was spared given that there were only 5 deaths. The fog then reappears along with the ghosts, and Blake decapitates Malone, making 6.

","The Fog's central themes are revenge and the resurfacing of ""repressed past events"" in small-town America,[4] as it focuses on the supernatural vengeance inflicted on the residents of a community that has prospered from looted salvage.[5] William Fischer of Collider describes the film as one preoccupied with ""an all-American town getting ready to celebrate its founding, a founding marred by a dark crime. When Father Patrick Malone discovers the horrible truth and brings it to the attention of Mayor Kathy Williams, she shrugs it off and dismisses any impact or introspection it might cast over the centenary. It was so long ago, she reasons, and what is there to do about it? And she has a point; there’s no changing the past, and at a certain distance, there’s no rectifying it.""[6]

Writer Peter Hutchings notes that, while the film contains these implicit themes, that Carpenter is ""more interested in conjuring up a sinister atmosphere than he is in exploring some of the social ramifications of such a story"".","### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Other**: The primary themes in ""The Fog"" revolve around supernatural vengeance, repressed past events, and the darker facets of small-town America. These themes are not directly related to motherhood, gender-based violence, female sexuality, or beauty and aging.
2. **Other**: The focus on the town’s history and the ethical implications of its founding suggest a broader commentary on guilt and moral reckoning rather than specific themes tied to womanhood.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
- **Professional role related to beauty or perfection**: The closest fit for one of the protagonists, Stevie Wayne, could be under a professional role related to beauty or perfection as she is a local radio DJ. Her role is influential within the community, but it doesn't neatly fit the traditional categories of dancer, model, or actress. 

### Monstrous Feminine:
- **Other**: Stevie Wayne and the other female characters in the movie do not fit the archetypes of the monstrous-feminine as outlined by Barbara Creed. The ghosts and supernatural entities in the film are the primary sources of horror rather than a monstrous representation of femininity.

### Protagonist's Fate:
- **Survives**: Stevie Wayne survives the events of the film despite facing significant danger from the supernatural entities.

### Focus of the Story:
- **Victimization**: The story primarily focuses on the townspeople, including Stevie Wayne, combating the immediate supernatural threat. While Stevie displays resourcefulness and courage (especially in trying to save her son and warning others), the overarching narrative centers on the residents’ struggle for survival rather than highlighting female empowerment through gained autonomy or agency.",5,5,2,1,2,1
Scanners,1981,David Cronenberg,M,Jennifer O'Neill,F,"After a man with extraordinary—and frighteningly destructive—telepathic abilities is nabbed by agents from a mysterious rogue corporation, he discovers he is far from the only possessor of such strange powers, and that some of the other “scanners” have their minds set on world domination, while others are trying to stop them.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanners,"Cameron Vale is a vagrant suffering from voices manifesting in his head. After involuntarily causing a woman to have a seizure with his telepathy, Vale is captured by the private military company ConSec and brought to Dr. Paul Ruth.

Ruth explains that Vale is one of 237 super-powered individuals known as ""scanners"" capable of telepathy, empathy, biokinesis, technopathy and psychokinesis. Ruth injects Vale with a drug called ""ephemerol,"" which restores his sanity by temporarily inhibiting his scanning abilities, and teaches him to control them. ConSec is recruiting scanners to stop a malevolent underground ring of scanners led by Darryl Revok, a former mental patient who was driven mad from hearing uncontrollable streams of thoughts.

Revok, on his quest to kill opposing scanners, infiltrates a ConSec marketing event and explodes the head of a ConSec scanner. ConSec security head Braedon Keller advocates shutting down their scanner research program but Ruth disagrees, believing the scanners are the next stage of human evolution, and argues that the assassination demonstrates Revok's danger. Ruth brings in Vale and asks him to help infiltrate Revok's group.

Unknown to Ruth, Keller is working for Revok and informs him of Ruth's infiltration plan. Revok dispatches assassins to follow Vale as he visits an unaffiliated scanner named Benjamin Pierce, a successful yet reclusive sculptor who copes with his abilities through his art. Revok's assassins murder Pierce, but Vale reads Pierce's dying brain and learns of a group of scanners, led by Kim Obrist, who oppose Revok's group. Vale tracks down Obrist and attends a meeting, but Revok's assassins strike again; only Vale and Obrist survive.

Vale learns of a pharmaceutical company, Biocarbon Amalgamate, which he soon discovers Revok is using to distribute large quantities of ephemerol under a ConSec computer program called ""Ripe."" Vale and Obrist return to ConSec to investigate, and Ruth admits that he founded Biocarbon Amalgamate and suggests Vale cyberpathically scan the computer system to learn more. Keller attacks Obrist and kills Ruth while Vale and Obrist flee the ConSec building. Vale cyberpathically hacks into the computer network through a telephone booth and downloads ephemerol shipment information directly into his mind. Keller is killed when the computer explodes during his attempt to intercept Vale. Vale and Obrist visit a doctor on the list of ephemerol recipients and discover that it is prescribed to pregnant women, turning their children into scanners. Revok's group captures Vale and Obrist and take them to the Biocarbon Amalgamate plant.

Revok reveals to Vale that they are both children of Ruth, who developed ephemerol as a sedative for pregnant women. Ruth learned about the drug's side-effect during his wife's pregnancies, and he made them the most powerful scanners in the world by administering a prototype dosage prior to abandoning them. Revok plans to create and lead a new generation of scanners to take over the world, but Vale refuses to join him. Vale accuses Revok of acting like his father, enraging him. The brothers engage in a telepathic duel, which incinerates Vale's body. However, when Obrist encounters Revok, she discovers that Vale somehow has managed to take over Revok's body during the duel.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
**1. Motherhood:**
- The themes of pregnancy and childbirth are central to the plot, as it is revealed that the drug ephemerol is prescribed to pregnant women, causing their children to become scanners. This ties directly into the theme of altered motherhood and the consequences of medical experimentation on pregnant women and their offspring.

**2. Other (Not explicitly listed categories but tied to scientific and ethical implications for motherhood):**
- The ethical and scientific implications of using pregnant women in medical experiments, which ultimately affect their children, do not fit neatly into the categories of gender-based violence, female sexuality, or beauty and aging. Instead, they expand on the broader ethical concerns related to motherhood and the impact on future generations.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
**1. Other:**
- The main protagonist, Cameron Vale, is male. However, the female character Kim Obrist, who is also a scanner, collaborates with Vale. Obrist does not fit into traditional female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. She is more of an ally and fellow fighter against the antagonist forces and does not fit the categories listed (mother, housewife, adolescent girl, or professional role).

### Monstrous Feminine:
**1. Other:**
- The female protagonist, Kim Obrist, is not portrayed as a monster. The monstrous aspects are primarily depicted through male characters like Darryl Revok and the telepathic duel with Cameron Vale. The horror elements relate to telepathy and biokinesis rather than the seven 'faces' of the monstrous feminine described by Barbara Creed.

### Fate of the Female Protagonist:
**2. Survives**
- Kim Obrist survives the events of the movie. 

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
**1. Victimization:**
- While there are elements of survival and collaboration, Kim Obrist primarily plays a victim role, subjected to physical and psychic threats throughout the film without gaining significant autonomy or empowerment. The story is more about immediate survival in the face of powerful antagonists rather than taking control over her own story or gaining substantial agency.",1,5,2,1,2,1

It is revealed that the real Angela died in the accident and Peter survived. After Martha gained custody of him, she decided to raise Peter as the girl she always wanted, already having a son. It is implied that Peter was mentally affected by seeing his father sharing a homosexual embrace with another man.

The nude and blood-covered ""Angela"" (with male genitalia in full view), stands before the shocked Susie and Ronnie who discover that she is the killer; Angela stares vacantly at both of them, hissing and growling at them like a wild animal.",,"### **Sleepaway Camp Analysis**

#### **Themes Related to Womanhood**

1. **Gender Based Violence**: Angela (who is later revealed to be Peter) experiences various forms of bullying, harassment, and attempted sexual assault. The head cook Artie attempts to molest Angela, representing a clear theme of gender-based violence.
2. **Other - Gender Identity and Psychological Trauma**: A critical theme in this movie is the forced gender identity imposed by Angela's (Peter's) aunt and the psychological trauma resulting from this. This theme involves complex elements of identity, mental health, and gender dysphoria, which do not fit neatly into the predefined categories but are essential themes related to the character’s experiences.

#### **Role of the Main Protagonist**

5. **Other**: Angela (Peter) does not neatly fit into traditional female roles related to femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. Raised as a girl by an eccentric aunt who wanted a daughter, Angela is not a mother, an adolescent girl, a beauty professional, or a caretaker. Angela's role is primarily that of a traumatized child grappling with an imposed gender identity and significant psychological issues.

#### **Portrayal as a Monster**

1. **Monstruous Feminine**: Angela is portrayed as a monstrous figure by the end of the film. Conforming to Barbara Creed's concept of The Monstrous-Feminine, particularly in the sense of the castrator and monstrous mother (through the imposed gender identity by the aunt, who acts as a surrogate mother). Angela's final reveal and the horrific acts committed position the character as a literal and symbolic monster within the narrative.

#### **Fate of the Protagonist**

2. **Survives**: Angela (Peter) survives till the end of the movie, although the character's future is left ambiguous, staring vacantly and hissing and growling at the shocked onlookers.

#### **Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment**

1. **Victimization**: The story centers on Angela's traumatic experiences and victimization rather than empowerment. Angela is subjected to bullying, gender identity confusion, psychological trauma, and violent situations. Throughout the film, Angela is depicted as a vulnerable character who suffers immensely and ultimately responds with violence and rage, indicating a theme more aligned with victimization than empowerment.",5,5,1,1,2,1
What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,1962,Robert Aldrich,M,Bette Davis,F,"Two aging film actresses live as virtual recluses in an old Hollywood mansion. Jane Hudson, a successful child star, cares for her crippled sister Blanche, whose career in later years eclipsed that of Jane. Now the two live together, their relationship affected by simmering subconscious thoughts of mutual envy, hate and revenge.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Ever_Happened_to_Baby_Jane%3F_(film),"In 1917, ""Baby Jane"" Hudson is a spoiled and capricious child actress who performs in vaudeville theaters across the country with her father, who acts as her manager and accompanies her on stage on the piano. Her success is such that a line of porcelain dolls is made in her image. Meanwhile, her shy older sister Blanche lives in her shadow and is treated with contempt by the haughty Jane.

As the sisters pass adolescence, their situations undergo a reversal; Jane's style of performing falls out of fashion, and her career declines as she descends into alcoholism, while Blanche becomes an acclaimed Hollywood actress. Mindful of a promise made to their mother, Blanche attempts to maintain a semblance of a career for Jane, going as far as to prevail on producers to guarantee acting roles for her. One evening in 1935, Blanche's career is cut short when she is paralyzed from the waist down in a mysterious car accident that is unofficially blamed on Jane, who is found three days later in a drunken stupor.

By 1962, Blanche and Jane are living together in a mansion purchased with Blanche's film earnings. Blanche's mobility is limited due to her reliance on a wheelchair and the lack of an elevator to her upstairs bedroom. Jane, psychotic and resentful of Blanche's success, regularly mistreats Blanche and prepares to revive her old act with hired pianist Edwin Flagg. When Blanche informs Jane she intends to sell the house, Jane correctly suspects Blanche will commit her to a psychiatric hospital once the house is sold. She removes the telephone from Blanche's bedroom, cutting her off from the outside world.

During Jane's absence, Blanche desperately drags herself down the stairs and calls her doctor for help. Jane returns to find Blanche on the phone and beats her unconscious before mimicking Blanche's voice to dismiss the doctor. After tying Blanche to her bed and locking her in her room, Jane abruptly fires their housekeeper, Elvira, when she comes to work. While Jane is away, the suspicious Elvira sneaks into the house and attempts to access Blanche's room. Concerned by the lack of a response, Elvira starts to remove the door's hinge pins with a hammer. Jane returns home and reluctantly gives Elvira the key. As soon as Elvira enters Blanche's room, Jane takes the hammer and kills Elvira. Edwin comes by the house, but Jane refuses to answer the door. That night, she uses Blanche's wheelchair to move Elvira's body to her car.

A few days later, the police call to tell Jane that Elvira's cousin has reported her missing. Jane panics and prepares to leave, taking Blanche with her. Before they can go, an inebriated Edwin is escorted to the house by police, who leave him there. Upon discovering Blanche bound to her bed, Edwin flees and notifies the authorities. Jane, in a fit of infantile regression, takes Blanche to a beach where she sang as a child.

The next morning, the news of Elvira's murder and Blanche's condition is on the radio and the police are on the lookout. Weakened and near death, Blanche confesses to Jane that she caused her own accident. On the night in question, Blanche tried to run Jane over because she was angry at her drunken sister for mocking her at a party. Blanche's spine broke when her car struck the gates outside their mansion, and she dragged herself in front of the car's hood to stage the accident and frame Jane. Blanche took advantage of Jane's shock and subsequent bender, concealing the real cause of the accident from her, which subjected Jane to a life of guilt, loneliness, and servitude.

Now aware of the truth, a saddened Jane responds, ""You mean all this time, we could have been friends?"" When Jane gets ice cream for herself and Blanche from a nearby refreshment stand, she is recognized by two police officers, who ask her to lead them to Blanche, attracting the attention of nearby beachgoers. Jane dodges the officers' inquiry and dances before the crowd of curious onlookers. The officers find Blanche nearby and rush to save her.

1. **Other** - Psychological trauma and sibling rivalry: The movie deeply explores the psychological effects of childhood fame, rivalry, and the mental health issues stemming from unaddressed trauma between the two sisters. It focuses on how those issues evolve and affect their lives as adults.
2. **Other** - Dependency and isolation: A significant theme of the film is the dependency of Blanche on Jane due to her disability, and the isolation that comes from that dependency, which allows Jane to exert control and abuse over her sister.

**Role of the Main Protagonist:**
- **Other** - The main female characters, Blanche and Jane, do not fit neatly into the provided categories. Blanche is a former Hollywood actress who is now disabled and dependent on her sister, while Jane is a former child star whose career has declined. Jane has taken on a caretaker role but is also the abuser.

**Main Protagonist as a Monster:**
- **Monstruous feminine** - Jane can be seen as fitting with Barbara Creed's analysis, as she embodies the archetype of the monstrous mother and castrator, exerting control and inflicting harm on Blanche due to her combined feelings of guilt, resentment, and psychosis. Her actions and mental state align with the ""monstrous feminine"" through her use of power and manipulation.

**Main Protagonist's Fate:**
- **Survives** - Both Jane and Blanche survive until the end of the movie. However, Blanche is left near death due to the lack of proper care and her weakened condition.

**Female Victimization or Empowerment:**
- **Victimization** - The story focuses heavily on the victimization of both Blanche and Jane, but primarily on Blanche, who is subjected to physical and emotional abuse by Jane. The movie showcases their struggle but provides no clear empowerment, as they both are trapped in a cycle of mutual torment. While there is a moment of revelation and potential understanding at the end, it does not culminate in empowerment for either character.",5,3,1,1,2,1
Carrie,2013,Kimberly Peirce,F,Chloë Grace Moretz,F,"A reimagining of the classic horror tale about Carrie White, a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_(2013_film),"Carrie White is a shy, unpopular girl from Ewen High School in Maine. While showering after gym class, Carrie unexpectedly experiences her first menstrual period. Believing she is bleeding to death, she runs out yelling for help, but the other girls ridicule her by throwing tampons and pads at her. Bully Christine ""Chris"" Hargensen records everything on her cell phone and uploads it to YouTube.

The school's physical education teacher Miss Rita Desjardin, comforts Carrie and sends her home with her disturbed, religious fanatic mother Margaret White, who believes menstruation is a sin. Margaret demands that Carrie abstain from showering with the others. When Carrie refuses, Margaret hits her in the forehead with a Bible and locks her in her ""prayer closet"". As Carrie screams to be let out, a crack appears on the door, and the crucifix in the closet begins to bleed. Carrie begins to experience more telekinetic abilities and researches her abilities, learning to harness them.

Miss Desjardin threatens the girls who teased Carrie with an ultimatum: either endure detention for their behavior or be suspended from school, prohibiting them from attending prom; Chris is the only one who refuses to take part in detention and is suspended. Sue Snell regrets her part in the incident. To make amends, she asks her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts Tommy's invitation and makes a prom dress at home. Carrie asks her mother to let her go to prom, and Carrie manifests her telekinesis. Margaret believes this power comes from the Devil and is proof that Carrie has been corrupted by sin.

On prom night, Margaret tries to prevent Carrie from going, but Carrie uses her powers to lock her mother in the closet. At prom, as part of Chris and her boyfriend Billy's plan, Chris's friend, Tina Blake, discreetly slips fake ballots into the voting box, which names Carrie and Tommy as prom queen and king. At home, Sue receives a text from Chris, taunting her about her scheme to humiliate Carrie. Sue drives to the prom, arriving just as Carrie and Tommy are about to be crowned. Sue sees the bucket of blood dangling above Carrie and attempts to warn someone, but Desjardin locks her out of the gym, suspecting that Sue plans to hurt Carrie.

Chris dumps the blood onto Carrie and Tommy, and Nicki plays the ""shower video"" of Carrie on the large screens, inciting laughter from the audience. Carrie pushes Miss Desjardin with her powers when Desjardin attempts to help her. The bucket falls onto Tommy's head, killing him. Enraged, Carrie uses her telekinesis to kill every student and staff but spares Desjardin. An electrical wire merges with leaking water, and a fire breaks out. As the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away. Chris and Billy attempt to drive away, but Carrie crashes the car, killing Billy. Chris attempts to run Carrie over, but Carrie lifts the car and throws it at a gas station, killing her.

Carrie arrives home, takes a bath, and changes. Carrie tearfully tells Margaret about the prank, and Margaret recounts Carrie's conception, revealing that Carrie's father raped her, and Carrie's birth made her believe that Carrie is a sin she must pay for. Margaret stabs Carrie with a knife, believing that she must kill Carrie in order to prevent the Devil from possessing her again, and attacks Carrie, but Carrie kills her with many sharp tools. She becomes hysterical and makes stones rain from the sky to crush the house. When Sue arrives, a furious Carrie lifts her with her powers but senses that Sue is pregnant. Carrie protects Sue and throws her out of the house to safety as the house collapses and sinks, apparently killing Carrie as well.

After giving her testimony in court regarding the prom incident, Sue visits Carrie and Margaret's grave and places white roses by the headstone. As she leaves, the gravestone begins to break, and an enraged scream is heard, alluding that Carrie may have somehow survived.

Alternate ending
After placing the roses on Carrie's grave, Sue suddenly feels pain from her pregnancy and begins to go into labor.

A Tale of Two Sisters,2003,Kim Jee-woon,M,Lim Soo-jung,F,"A recently released patient from a mental institution returns home with her sister, only to face disturbing events between her stepmother and the ghosts haunting their house- all of which are connected to a dark past in the family's history.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Sisters,"A teenage girl, Su-mi, is being treated for shock and psychosis in a mental institution. Soon after, she is returning home to her family's secluded estate in the countryside with her father and younger sister Su-yeon, whom she is protective of. The sisters have a cold reunion with their stepmother, Eun-joo, who constantly requires medication. Eun-joo also has a strained relationship with her husband, both of them enduring a sexless marriage.

Su-yeon has a nightmare of her late mother's ghost. The next day, Su-mi finds family photos which reveal that Eun-joo was formerly an in-home nurse for her then-terminally ill mother. She discovers bruises on her sister's arms and suspects Eun-joo is responsible. Su-mi confronts Eun-joo about the bruises but Eun-joo refuses to apologize for her actions. That night, their uncle and aunt arrive for dinner, and Eun-joo tells bizarre stories that bewilder them. The aunt suddenly suffers a violent seizure and suffocates. After recovering, she tells her husband that she saw the ghost of a dead girl beneath the kitchen sink during her seizure. Eun-joo tries to see what is beneath the sink, but the ghost girl violently grabs her arm.

Eun-joo's relationship with her stepdaughters sours after she finds her pet bird mutilated and killed and her personal photographs defaced. She believes that these actions are somehow connected to the girls and locks Su-yeon in the wardrobe. Su-mi releases her and tells her father about the abuse. Her father begs her to stop acting out and informs her that Su-yeon is dead. Su-mi refuses to believe it as she is sure her sister is right next to her sobbing uncontrollably.

The next morning, Eun-joo drags a bloodied sack through the house, whipping it. Su-mi believes that Su-yeon is inside the sack. Eun-joo and Su-mi get into a violent physical altercation. Su-mi's father arrives to find an unconscious Su-mi.

It is ultimately revealed that Su-mi and her father were alone in the house the entire time. Su-mi had suffered from dissociative identity disorder, where she possessed two personalities: herself and a ruder, more distant variation of her stepmom Eun-joo. The ""body"" in the sack that Su-mi was whipping was actually a porcelain doll and she was also the one who killed the pet bird. Su-yeon was also revealed to be long dead; her presence was actually the result of Su-mi's hallucinations.

The father and the real Eun-joo send Su-mi back to the mental institution. Eun-joo tries to reconcile with Su-mi, promising to visit her as often as she can, but Su-mi rebuffs her. That night, Eun-joo hears footsteps in Su-yeon's old bedroom, revealing that the ghost actually exists. Su-yeon's real ghost crawls out of the wardrobe and kills Eun-joo. Meanwhile, Su-mi smiles, appearing to have finally found peace.

Flashbacks reveal the day that led Su-mi to be institutionalized. While her terminally ill mother was still alive, her father engaged in an adulterous affair with Eun-joo, when she was still their in-home nurse. This upsets the sisters and drives their mother to hang herself in the wardrobe of Su-yeon's bedroom. Su-yeon attempts to revive her but the wardrobe collapses on top of her. Eun-joo sees Su-yeon thrashing and suffocating and at the last minute, decides to save Su-yeon. However, Su-mi arrives and criticises Eun-joo for interfering with her family.

Friday the 13th Part 2,1981,Steve Miner,M,Amy Steel,F,"Five years after the horrible bloodbath at Camp Crystal Lake, it seems Jason Voorhees and his demented mother are in the past. Paul opens up a new camp close to the infamous site, ignoring warnings to stay away, and a sexually-charged group of counselors follow -- including child psychologist major Ginny. But Jason has been hiding out all this time, and now he's ready for revenge.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th_Part_2,"Two months after the murders at Camp Crystal Lake, sole survivor Alice Hardy is recovering from her traumatic experience. In her apartment, when Alice opens the refrigerator to get her cat some food, she finds the severed head of Pamela Voorhees and is murdered with an ice pick to her temple by an unknown intruder.

Five years later, Paul Holt has opened a school for camp counselors on the shore of Crystal Lake. The camp is attended by Sandra, her boyfriend Jeff, Scott, Terry, the wheelchair-bound Mark, Vickie, Ted, and Paul's assistant Ginny, as well as many other trainees. Around the campfire that night, Paul tells the counselors the legend of Jason Voorhees, a boy who drowned at Camp Crystal Lake in 1957, sending his vengeful mother on two killing sprees in 1958 and 1979, until she was eventually killed by Alice Hardy in self-defense. According to the legend, Jason survived and is now living in the woods near Crystal Lake; enraged at his mother's death, he will kill anyone he comes across. As Paul finishes the story, a man with a spear scares everyone, but it's revealed to be Ted wearing a mask. Paul reassures everyone that Jason is dead and that Camp Crystal Lake is now condemned and off-limits.

That night, Crazy Ralph wanders onto the property to warn the group but is garroted from behind a tree by an unseen killer. The following day, Jeff and Sandra sneak off to Camp Crystal Lake and find a dog carcass before getting caught by Deputy Winslow and returning to the camp. Later, Winslow spots a man wearing a burlap sack mask running across the road. Winslow chases him into the woods and finds a shack. The man kills Winslow with a hammer claw.

Back at camp, Paul offers the others one last night in town before the training begins. Six of them stay behind, including Jeff and Sandra, who are forced to stay as punishment for sneaking off. At the bar, Ginny muses that if Jason were still alive and had witnessed his mother's death, it may have left him with no distinction between life and death, or right and wrong. Paul dismisses the idea, proclaiming that Jason is nothing but an urban legend. Meanwhile, the assailant appears at the camp and kills the counselors, one by one. Scott has his throat slit with a machete while caught in a rope trap, and Terry is killed off-screen upon finding Scott's dead body. Mark has a machete slammed into his face, and he falls down a flight of stairs as he dies. The killer then moves upstairs and impales Jeff and Sandra with a spear as they have sex, then stabs Vickie to death with a kitchen knife.

Ted stays behind at the bar while Ginny and Paul return to find the place in disarray. In the dark, the killer ambushes Paul and continues to chase Ginny throughout the camp and into the woods, where she comes across the shack. After barricading herself inside, she finds an altar with Pamela Voorhees' severed head on it, surrounded by a pile of bodies. Realizing that Jason Voorhees is the killer, Ginny puts on Pamela's sweater and tries to convince Jason that she is his mother psychologically. The ruse briefly works, until Jason sees his mother's head on the altar and awakens from the trance. Paul suddenly returns and tries to save Ginny, but Jason incapacitates him. Just as Jason is about to kill Paul with a pickaxe, Ginny picks up a machete and slams it down into Jason's shoulder, seemingly killing him.

Paul and Ginny return to the cabin and hear someone outside. Thinking that Jason has followed them, they open the door, only to find Terry's dog, Muffin. Just as they sigh in relief, an unmasked Jason bursts through the window from behind and grabs Ginny. She then awakens to being loaded into an ambulance and calls out for Paul, who is nowhere to be seen, leaving his fate unknown. Back in the shack, Pamela's head remains on the altar, but Jason is nowhere to be found.

Believing Kristen to be suicidal, her mother admits her to Westin Hills Psychiatric Hospital, where she is placed under the care of Dr. Neil Gordon. At the hospital, Kristen fights the orderlies who try to sedate her because she fears falling asleep. The new intern therapist, Nancy Thompson, calms her down by reciting Freddy's nursery rhyme, making her realize she is not alone. Nancy meets the rest of Dr. Gordon's patients: Phillip, a sleepwalker; Kincaid, a tough kid from the streets; Jennifer, a hopeful television actress; Will, who uses a wheelchair due to a prior suicide attempt; Taryn, a recovering drug addict; and Joey, who is too traumatized to speak.

Kristen reveals that she has been able to pull people into her dreams since she was young. Over the next two nights, Freddy kills Phillip and Jennifer. Nancy reveals to the remaining patients that they are ""the last of the Elm Street kids,"" the surviving children of those who burned Krueger to death years ago. They try group hypnosis so that they can experience a shared dream and discover their dream powers. In the dream, Freddy captures Joey, leaving him comatose in the real world.

Onibaba,1964,Kaneto Shindō,M,Nobuko Otowa,F,"While her son, Kichi, is away at war, a woman and her daughter-in-law survive by killing samurai who stray into their swamp, then selling whatever valuables they find. Both are devastated when they learn that Kichi has died, but his wife soon begins an affair with a neighbor who survived the war, Hachi. The mother disapproves and, when she can't steal Hachi for herself, tries to scare her daughter-in-law with a mysterious mask from a dead samurai.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onibaba_(film),"The film is set somewhere in Japan near Kyoto, in the mid-14th century, at the beginning of the Nanboku-chō period, shortly after the Battle of Minatogawa. Two fleeing soldiers are ambushed in a large field of tall, thick reeds and murdered by an older woman and her young daughter-in-law. The two women loot the dead soldiers, strip them of their armour and weapons, and drop the bodies in a deep pit hidden in the field. The next day, they take the armor and weapons to a merchant named Ushi and trade them for food. The merchant tells them news of the war, which is driving people across the country to desperation. As they leave, Ushi makes a sexual proposition to the older woman, who rebuffs him. A neighbor named Hachi, who has been at war, returns. The two women ask about Kishi, who was both the older woman's son and younger woman's husband, and was drafted along with Hachi. Hachi tells them that they deserted the war and that Kishi was later killed when they were caught stealing food from farmers. The older woman warns the younger woman to stay away from Hachi, whom she blames for her son's death.

Hachi begins to show interest in the younger woman and, despite being warned to stay away from Hachi, she is seduced by him. She begins to sneak out every night to run to his hut and have sex. The older woman learns of the relationship and is both angry and jealous. She tries to seduce Hachi herself, but is coldly rebuffed. She then pleads with him to not take her daughter-in-law away, since she cannot kill and rob passing soldiers without her help.

One night, while Hachi and the younger woman are together, a lost samurai wearing a Hannya mask forces the older woman to guide him out of the field. He claims to wear the mask to protect his incredibly handsome face from harm. She tricks him into plunging to his death in the pit where the women dispose of their victims. She climbs down and steals the samurai's possessions and, with great difficulty, his mask, revealing the samurai's horribly disfigured face.

At night, as the younger woman goes to see Hachi, the older woman blocks her path, wearing the samurai's robes and hannya mask, frightening the girl into running home. During the day, the older woman further convinces the younger woman that the ""demon"" was real, as punishment for her affair with Hachi. The younger woman avoids Hachi during the day, but continues to try and see him at night. During a storm, the older woman again terrifies the younger woman with the mask, but Hachi, tired of being ignored, finds the younger woman and has sex with her in the grass as her mother-in-law watches. The older woman realizes that despite all her warnings, her daughter-in-law wants to be with Hachi. Hachi returns to his hut, where he discovers another deserter stealing his food; the deserter abruptly grabs his spear and stabs Hachi, killing him.

The older woman discovers that, after getting wet in the rain, the mask is impossible to remove. She reveals her scheme to her daughter-in-law and pleads for her to help take off the mask. The younger woman agrees to remove the mask after the older woman promises not to interfere with her relationship with Hachi. After failing to pull it off, the young woman breaks off the mask with a mallet. Under the mask, the older woman's face is now disfigured, as the deceased Samurai had been. It is implied that the previously removable mask was accursed by supernatural means, binding itself permanently to its wearer's face by the power of rain (a metaphysical symbol of Buddhist punishment), but the truth behind the implied origin is never fully revealed. The younger woman, now believing her mother-in-law has turned into an actual demon, flees; the older woman runs after her, crying out that she is a human being, not a demon. The young woman leaps over the pit, and as the older woman leaps after her, the film ends.","While Onibaba is said to gain its inspiration from the Shin Buddhist parable by Kaneto Shizawa's discretion, onibaba also refers to traditional tall tales and ghost stories throughout Japan of vicious and monstrous elderly demon women said to stalk about various areas and wilderness to hunt for human victims to take back to their lairs and feast on them. This can be seen through how both the mother and daughter in law lurk about their home territory of the fen which they live in, awaiting stragglers and lost soldiers of war before killing them for their valuables in order to purchase and gather food in their desperate times. It is of some consideration that such tales of evildoings of men in such times may be the inspiration for how such tales may have been started in the first place, as such atrociousness would in turn not be accepted by any normal human being as possible by men. In terms of Japanese spirituality and Shinto, there are also themes of how gross vice and evil can eventually turn one into demons and monsters themselves in time, which is catalyzed by the mother wearing the cursed mask, which itself may be cursed or afflicted with a severe infectious disease, transforming her into a literal onibaba.

With the outbreak of the Onin War, Onibaba also portrays an almost post-apocalyptic level of societal breakdown and moral degeneracy; as Kyoto was valued as Japan's capital long before the rise of the city of Edo and the reestablishment of the Shogunate's power by Tokugawa Ieyasu, the violence and warfare of the Onin War eventually spread throughout Kyoto itself, completely causing chaos and throwing Japan into turmoil because of its abandonment and desolation as Japan's center of politics, religion, and economics into the twilight of the Nanbokucho era. Its reach of anarchy can be felt into the rural lives of the mother and daughter-in-law and their neighbors, lacking community to ensure moral guidance and direction, delving into wanton abandon as their lives become more of a struggle to survive and desolate of human interaction, and pushing them to go as far as to commit what would be heinous crimes and atrocities in more peaceful times, but has now been necessitated to be essential to surviving their meager and bleak times.

With origins from Buddhist themes, the film is evocative of the Third Age of Buddhism (Japanese: Mappo) which in Heian Era depictions, spoke of how demons from Hell sent forth by the infernal King Enma to be unleashed upon the earth, and hunt eagerly for sinners, degenerates, and non—believers to throw into eternal damnation.

Incantation,2022,Kevin Ko,M,Hsuan-yen Tsai,F,"Inspired by a true story of a family who believed they were possessed by spirits, this film follows a woman who must protect her child from a curse.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation_(film),"A woman named Li Ronan implores the viewer to memorize an insignia and chant an incantation to send blessings and lift the curse on her six-year-old daughter, Dodo. The insignia and incantation are interspersed frequently throughout the film to encourage the viewer to pray along. The events are shown as found footage in a non-linear manner. The written plot is in chronological order.

Six years earlier, a newly-pregnant Ronan, her boyfriend Dom, and Dom's cousin Yuan break a serious religious taboo while documenting a ritual for their online video channel. They visit Dom and Yuan's relatives in a remote clan mountain village, where the villagers practice an esoteric Yunnan religion, worshipping an ancestral deity called Mother Buddha. They spy on the clan preparing a child for sacrifice. The unconscious child, whose body is covered in runes, is left in front of a tunnel that the clan has expressly forbidden the trio from entering. Dom and Yuan enter the tunnel; Yuan shortly emerges, screaming, while Dom's dead body is carried out by the villagers. The footage from within the tunnel shot by Dom and Yuan has since become damaged. After Dodo is born, Ronan leaves her at a foster care home and seeks psychiatric help.

In the present, Ronan has recovered and is taking Dodo to live with her, feeling ready. However, Dodo is disturbed by a malicious presence and develops a debilitating illness. When social workers arrive to take Dodo away, feeling that Ronan is unsuitable, the mother and daughter escape with the help of Ming, the sympathetic manager of the foster home. They bring Dodo to a shrine, where a priest and his wife forbid her from eating for the next seven days, but when runes appear all over her body, Ronan feeds her in desperation. The priest and his wife are violently killed and Dodo deteriorates.

Ming goes to Yunnan to conduct more research into the esoteric religion and has the damaged tunnel footage professionally restored. After watching the restored footage, he becomes possessed and kills himself. In the footage, it is shown that Dom and Yuan passed disturbing items laid ritualistically throughout the tunnel, which led to the altar of Mother Buddha. When removing the veil from Mother Buddha's face, Dom becomes possessed and dies. Yuan makes it out but is violently killed by unseen forces. The villagers burned Dom's body, and their bodies were also covered in runes.

Ronan confesses that she has been lying to the viewer all along. The priest Ming visited in Yunnan revealed that Mother Buddha is in fact a malevolent entity; if one submits one's name with the incantation, it means one agrees to carry her curse. Instead of conveying blessings, the incantation actually serves to dilute the curse; when more people chant it, the curse spreads out and the burden on those bearing it becomes lighter, with fewer misfortunes befalling them. Mother Buddha's face has to be covered because it is the source of the curse. Ronan returns Dodo to the foster home and travels back to the tunnel in the now-abandoned village. At the altar, she reveals Mother Buddha's face on camera, intending to curse the viewers to save her daughter. She then gets possessed and kills herself. The film ends with a happy and healthy Dodo, implying that the burden of her curse has been shared with everyone who watched the film, lightening its effects.
",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood**: The primary theme revolves around Ronan's role as a mother and her desperate attempts to lift a curse to save her daughter, Dodo. Her journey is driven by maternal instinct and sacrifice.
2. **Gender-based Violence**: The film involves elements of psychological and physical abuse through the rituals and the curse that Ronan and her daughter experience, although it is not explicitly centered on gender-based violence.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
Ronan plays **1) Mother or housewife**, as her actions throughout the film are primarily motivated by her role as a mother trying to protect her child.

### Monstrous Feminine:
Ronan's character fits into **1) Monstrous feminine** — particularly the ""monstrous mother"" archetype. She becomes associated with the malevolent entity of Mother Buddha and ultimately sacrifices herself to spread the curse to viewers, trying to save her daughter.

### Protagonist's Fate:
**1) Dies**: Ronan is possessed and kills herself in an attempt to spread the curse and save her daughter.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:
**1) Victimization**: The story centers around Ronan's victimization by the curse of Mother Buddha. Although she acts in a sacrificial manner to protect her daughter, she remains largely subjected to psychological and supernatural threats with minimal agency or autonomy. The storyline is more about her immediate survival and her ultimate tragic sacrifice rather than a narrative of empowerment.",1,1,1,1,1,2
In the Tall Grass,2019,Vincenzo Natali,M,Laysla De Oliveira,F,"After hearing a child screaming for help from the green depths of a vast field of tall grass, Becky, a pregnant woman, and Cal, her brother, park their car near a mysterious abandoned church and recklessly enter the field, discovering that they are not alone and because of some reason they are unable of escaping a completely inextricable vegetable labyrinth.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Tall_Grass_(film),"A pregnant Becky and her brother, Cal, are traveling to San Diego. While stopping along the way, they hear cries for help from a young boy named Tobin, who is accompanied by his mother, Natalie, in the tall grass. Concerned, the siblings enter but quickly get separated and find that their distance changes unnaturally. They decide to leave but can't find the road. Becky encounters Tobin's father, Ross, who tells her to stay close and not to lose sight of him, but she does so. Cal stumbles across Tobin, holding a dead crow. Tobin claims the grass won't move dead things and buries the bird in the path, telling Cal that a rock told him Becky would die soon. When Tobin leads Cal to a rock in the field and tells him to touch it, he hears Becky's scream before a ghost attacks him.

The father of Becky's child, Travis, arrives looking for the siblings. He investigates the field, stumbling across Tobin, who implies they know each other and leads him to Becky's corpse, saying that the field does not move dead things.

Tobin arrives at a nearby church with his parents. He and Freddy, the family dog, hear Travis shouting Tobin’s name from the grass. Freddy is drawn in, which leads Tobin, Natalie, and Ross to follow and get separated. With the family panicking, Becky and Cal re-enter the grass as Tobin states Freddy died. Travis, Becky, and Cal move toward Tobin, and all four find each other. Travis tells Becky and Cal that they have been missing for two months. It is also revealed that Travis originally was not interested in being a father and asked Becky to abort their baby, which she refused. As a result, Becky and Cal traveled to San Diego to meet a family interested in adopting her baby when it was born as she did not feel ready to be a single parent. Travis expresses regret and now wants to be part of his child and Becky's lives.

The group spots a building in the distance. Becky receives a phone call from someone warning them not to keep making the same ""mistake"". The grass seemingly enters Becky's uterus, and she passes out, only to be revived by Ross, who then reunites with Tobin and says he will show them out. Ross leads them to the rock, where they are confronted by Natalie who warns them not to touch the rock, and that Ross is dangerous, telling the others to leave. Travis attacks Ross who then dislocates his arm and crushes Natalie's head. Ross claims the rock showed him the truth and the way out, but he does not want to leave.

Becky, Cal, Travis, and Tobin reach the building, and while scouting, Travis and Cal discover that Freddy has managed to escape the field via a ""hole"" that leads to the road. Cal lets go of Travis as he slips, causing him to fall off the roof. Tobin flees into the field when Ross follows them to the roof. The two follow Tobin, but Becky refuses to leave Travis and goes back as Cal flees. Cal is strangled to death by Ross. It is revealed they are in a time loop, with Cal permanently being hunted by an insane, possessed Ross in the grass. Travis survives and searches for Becky.

Ross attacks Becky but she escapes, and a thunderstorm begins. Becky is confronted by Grass Creatures, who carry her to the rock, which has prophetic marks relating to her pregnancy. Becky makes a phone call, pleading for her past self to prevent Cal from hurting Travis. As she screams in pain from contractions, the ground underneath the rock opens, revealing multiple roots that turn into humanoid figures reaching toward her. She passes out and wakes up to Cal. He is holding her baby. She goes back to sleep and wakes up to Cal feeding her baby to her and telling her it is just grass and seeds. Becky realizes that ""Cal"" is Ross. Tobin finds Travis and tells him that Ross killed both the baby and Cal, and will keep killing them repeatedly. They are confronted by Ross, who mortally wounds Travis. As Ross attempts to force Tobin to touch the rock, Becky attacks him before dying from her wounds. Travis strangles Ross with bundled up grass. To understand, Travis touches the rock and sees strange visuals. He grabs Tobin's hand and guides him to an exit. He states that he isn't leaving and instructs Tobin to stop Becky and Cal from entering.

Tobin emerges across the road as Becky and Cal are about to enter the grass, convincing them to stay out by showing them Becky's necklace that Travis gave him, closing the loop. Becky decides to keep her baby as they drive back home. Travis listens to them leaving and then dies.

Repulsion,1965,Roman Polanski,M,Catherine Deneuve,F,"In Roman Polanski's first English-language film, beautiful young manicurist Carole suffers from androphobia (the pathological fear of interaction with men). When her sister and roommate, Helen, leaves their London flat to go on an Italian holiday with her married boyfriend, Carole withdraws into her apartment. She begins to experience frightful hallucinations, her fear gradually mutating into madness.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repulsion_(film),"Carol Ledoux, a shy Belgian manicurist, lives in London with her older sister Helen. Carol is remarkably detached and struggles in her daily interactions. A suitor, Colin, is enamoured with her and makes fervent attempts to court her, but Carol seems uninterested. Carol is troubled by Helen's relationship with a married man named Michael, whom Carol seems to dislike. She is bothered by his habit of leaving his razor and toothbrush in her glass in the bathroom, and at night struggles to sleep, bothered by the sounds of her sister and Michael having sex.

When Carol walks home from work one day, she is bothered by a crack in the pavement. Colin happens upon her and she struggles to converse with him. He drives her home and tries to kiss her several times, but she pulls away, running upstairs and vigorously brushing her teeth before weeping. That night, Helen questions Carol for dumping Michael's toothbrush and shaver in the bathroom trash bin. At the salon, Carol becomes increasingly distant, barely talking to her coworkers and customers, so much so that her boss decides to send her home for the day.

That night, Helen and Michael depart for Italy on holiday, leaving Carol alone in the apartment. Carol takes a rabbit out of the fridge for dinner. Instead of cooking it, she is distracted by a number of Michael's possessions left around the apartment, including an unwashed shirt whose odour makes her vomit. After trying on one of her sister's dresses, Carol sees a dark figure in the mirror. That night, she hears footsteps outside her bedroom. Carol's isolation begins to take its toll on her, and she misses three days of work. One morning, she runs a bath and walks away, causing it to overflow. As she turns on a light, the wall cracks open. She locks herself in her room and again hears footsteps. This time, she hallucinates that a man breaks into her room and rapes her. She is awakened in the hallway by a phone call from Colin, but she hangs up.

After returning to the salon, Carol cuts the finger of a client while giving a manicure, and is told to go home early. A concerned coworker finds the uncooked rabbit's head in Carol's purse. At the apartment, Carol stares at an old family photo and the wall behind the photograph shatters like a mirror. Colin subsequently arrives at the apartment, but Carol refuses to open the door so he breaks in. He declares his love for her, and she responds by bludgeoning him to death with a candlestick. She cleans the blood, barricades the front door, and places Colin's corpse in the bathtub. In bed, she experiences the same rape hallucination. She wakes up the next morning, naked on the floor. In a subsequent scene, she walks down the dark hallway of her apartment where hands appear out of the walls and grab her. Later, the angry wife of Michael calls looking for Helen, causing Carol to cut the wire of the telephone.

The landlord arrives to collect Carol and Helen's rent. After he is unable to get in due to the barricade, he breaks into the apartment and sees Carol. She pays him the rent, but he is disgusted by the state of the apartment. He sees the uncooked rabbit, still sitting out, rotting. He propositions Carol, offering to forget about the rent if she ""takes care of him"", and tries to rape her when she doesn't respond. She pushes him off and then hacks him to death with Michael's straight razor. She then sinks deeper into hallucination.

When Helen and Michael arrive home, Helen is dismayed at the state of the place. Michael happens on Helen hyperventilating and finds Colin's dead body in the bath. Helen finds Carol under her bed in a catatonic state. Her neighbours flood in as Michael picks her up and carries her out, smiling. In the living room, a family photo—the one Carol pondered earlier—shows Carol as a child, possibly staring at an older male family member in the photograph with a look of loathing, while others in the photo smile for the camera.

","The film is unusual for featuring a female killer.[6] It explores the repulsion Carol feels about sexuality in general and her suitors' pursuit of her in particular.[8]

It has been suggested that the film hints that her father may have sexually abused her as a child, which is the basis of her neuroses and breakdown.[9] Other critics have observed Carol's repeated usage of items related to her sister's boyfriend Michael,[10] and his presence greatly provoking Carol at the beginning of the film.[11]

The film also approaches the theme of boundary breaking, with Tamar McDonald stating that she saw Carol as refusing to conform to the expected ""path of femininity"".[12] It increasingly adopts the perspective of its protagonist. The dream sequences are particularly intense.[13]

Repulsion was considered the first instalment in Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy"", followed by Rosemary's Baby (1968) and The Tenant (1976), both of which are horror films that also take place primarily inside apartment buildings.","1. **Themes Related to Womanhood:**
    - **Female Sexuality (such as coming of age)**
      - The plot explores Carol's profound discomfort and repulsion towards sexuality and her suitors’ pursuits, suggesting an intense struggle with her own developing sexuality.
    - **Gender-Based Violence (such as sexual or physical assault or abuse)**

2. **Role of the Main Protagonist:**
    - **Other**
      - Carol does not fit neatly into the provided categories. She is a manicurist, which is a professional role, but not specifically related to beauty or perfection in the context provided. Her role seems more defined by her psychological state rather than her professional or societal role.

3. **Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?**
    - **Monstrous Feminine (possessed body)**
      - Carol can be seen as embodying the ""possessed body"" aspect of the monstrous-feminine. Her psychological breakdown and the violent acts she commits under the influence of her hallucinations and mental state position her within Barbara Creed's framework.

4. **Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?**
    - **Survives**
      - Carol is found in a catatonic state under her bed at the end of the movie but is alive.

5. **Is the Story Ultimately About Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?**

Under Paris,2024,Xavier Gens,M,Bérénice Bejo,F,"In order to save Paris from an international bloodbath, a grieving scientist is forced to face her tragic past when a giant shark appears in the Seine.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_Paris,"Near the Great Pacific garbage patch, marine researcher Sophia Assalas and her team search for Lilith, a tagged shortfin mako shark. Her husband Chris leads a dive team of Sam, Juan and Tom, leaving Sophia and Jade onboard. The team first observe an unusual sight of makos hunting in a pack, before they locate Lilith, who has grown much larger since she was last sighted. With the shark appearing non-aggressive, Chris attempts to take a blood sample from Lilith, but the shark suddenly snaps and kills him, Sam, Juan and Tom. Leaving the safety of the boat, Sophia goes after Lilith, but becomes entangled in a net and dragged far beneath the surface as the shark escapes into the depths. She manages to free herself, but not before suffering injuries due to the severe change in pressure.

Three years later, Sophia works at an aquarium in Paris. Mika and Ben, environmentalists, informs Sophia that Lilith's tracking beacon is still active and that she has travelled from the Pacific and up the River Seine and is seemingly trapped in the city. After a man is found dead with wounds from shark bites, police diver Adil recruits Sophia to help find and kill the shark, but Mika and Ben turn off the beacon before they can do so in the hope that they can rescue her later.

Sophia and Adil petition the Mayor of Paris to postpone the upcoming triathlon. The mayor refuses, emphasizing the event's importance for focusing global attention on Paris during the run-up to the Olympic Games which billions of euros have already been spent on. Mika reveals Lilith's existence to the public, and leads a group of supporters into the city's catacombs, where the city's wastewater reservoirs are, to find her. Ben tells Sophia of Mika's plan, and she and Adil's team head down into the catacombs to find them after reactivating Lilith's beacon.

Mika activates a pulse to lure Lilith to where her group have convened, and swims out to the middle of the reservoir. Adil's team arrives just as Lilith appears with a juvenile shark, Lilith's offspring. Mika refuses to hear warnings to get out of the water, and after she pets the juvenile shark, Lilith attacks and kills her, causing a mass panic that leads to many injuries and twelve deaths, including Ben and Leopold, a police officer on Adil's team. In the aftermath Sophia and Adil find the juvenile shark dead, and after examining it they discover that it has mutated to adapt to fresh water and that it is pregnant through parthenogenesis, and that if not caught Lilith may give birth to more mutated offspring. The Mayor, deflecting blame from herself, orders them to kill the shark, and still refuses to cancel the triathlon to be held in the river the following day. She takes part in a TV interview downplaying the danger the sharks present.

Sophia and Adil devise a plan to lure Lilith out of the catacombs and blow her up with the help of explosives experts Poiccard and Berruti. As the mayor declares the triathalon open, and swimmers take to the water, Adil's team Caro, Adama, Angèle and Markus begin to execute the plan. Underwater, Sophia and Adil encounter a large school of juvenile sharks as they set up their trap. The sharks kill Poiccard, Berruti and Adama before Adil sets the explosives off, seemingly destroying the school of young sharks and leaving the gigantic Lilith as the only survivor. She capsizes the police boat, killing Caro and Markus, and she heads towards the triathlon. The mayor and the spectators look on in horror as several swimmers are attacked and killed. The military open fire on Lilith, despite warnings from Adil that there are live shells on the riverbed. The disturbance in the water from their gunfire and Lilith's movements causes unexploded ordnance at the bottom of the river to shift and detonate, throwing the Mayor, Angèle, and many spectators into the water. The resulting chain reaction of explosions destroys several bridges and creates a tsunami that entirely floods the center of Paris. Sophia and Adil are left stranded on the roof of a building in the middle of the flood, surrounded by Lilith and the juvenile sharks that have survived the explosions.

As the end credits suggest, Lilith and her offspring have proliferated in the major river cities of the world (Paris, London, New York, Bangkok, Venice and Tokyo), and seem to have, as Sophia feared, colonized the entire world.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Other**: The themes here revolve around environmentalism and human intervention in natural habitats, particularly through the lens of Sophia's quest to track and manage the mutated shark Lilith. While there isn't an explicit connection to motherhood, gender-based violence, or female sexuality, the narrative does touch on themes like the hubris of humanity and the consequences of scientific and environmental neglect.

### Role of Main Protagonist:
**Other**: Sophia Assalas is a marine researcher and later works in an aquarium—both roles that don't fit neatly into the traditional categories of femininity, vulnerability, or weakness. Her role is more aligned with a scientist and environmentalist, taking an active and professional part in the plot's progression.

### Monstrous Feminine:
**Other**: Sophia is not portrayed as a monstrous feminine figure in the story. While she faces threats and challenges, she does not embody any of the seven 'faces' of the monstrous-feminine as defined by Barbara Creed. The concept of monstrosity is instead exemplified by the shark Lilith.

### Fate of the Protagonist:
**Survives**: Sophia is left stranded on a building roof amidst the flood created by the shark's actions, but she survives until the end credits.

### Focus of the Story:
**Victimization**: The story predominantly focuses on the physical threats posed by the shark Lilith and her offspring. While Sophia shows resilience and commitment, most of the plot revolves around immediate survival and trying to avert the catastrophic consequences of Lilith's presence. Sophia is subjected to immense peril and struggles to gain any meaningful autonomy over the unfolding events.",5,5,2,1,2,2
The Shallows,2016,Jaume Collet-Serra,M,Blake Lively,F,"When Nancy is surfing on a secluded beach, she finds herself on the feeding ground of a great white shark. Though she is stranded only 200 yards from shore, survival proves to be the ultimate test of wills, requiring all of Nancy's ingenuity, resourcefulness, and fortitude.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shallows_(film),"Shortly after the death of her mother due to cancer, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach in Mexico, the same beach her mother visited while she was pregnant with her. Carlos, a friendly local resident, gives Nancy a ride and drops her off at the beach, while a friend of hers who came along with her is staying back at a hotel after partying too much.

Nancy joins two other locals and the three surf for several hours. Taking a break from surfing, she video-chats with her younger sister Chloe. When she talks to her father in an emotional and strained conversation, it is revealed that Nancy is a senior student but her mother's death recently caused her to consider dropping out of medical school before graduation.

While surfing one last time for the day, Nancy notices the carcass of a young humpback whale nearby. As she rides the last wave back to the beach, a large 23 ft (7.0 m) great white shark knocks her off her surfboard and bites her leg. Nancy climbs onto the whale carcass, but the shark rams it from underneath, forcing her to swim to an isolated rock. She uses her surfboard leash to slow the bleeding from her leg. Later she uses her jewelry to put rudimentary stitches in place to hold her torn flesh together.

Nancy is left alone when the unaware locals leave the beach, and she spends the night on the rock with a wounded gull, which was also injured by the shark, and names him Steven Seagull. The next morning, Nancy gets the attention of a drunk local man on the beach and points to her backpack on the beach. When he finds it, he starts to steal Nancy's belongings then wades out into the water to take her surfboard and is killed by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water although Nancy tries to warn them away, and are also killed by the shark.

One of the local surfers was wearing a GoPro camera on his helmet. When he was attacked by the shark, his helmet came off and floated to the surface. Nancy later sees it floating in the water. After some struggle, she is able to retrieve it and notices in the footage of the attack, the shark has a large hook stuck in its mouth after a possible encounter with fishermen. Nancy uses the GoPro to leave messages for her sister and father as well as information about the shark attack and her location.

With the high tide approaching, Nancy realizes the rock will be submerged soon. After sending Steven Seagull toward shore on a piece of the surfboard, and timing the shark's circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby buoy, narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of jellyfish, which sting both the shark and her. Nancy finds a flare gun on the buoy.

Nancy shoots flares to draw the attention of a faraway cargo ship, but it has already turned away and does not see her. She then fires another flare at the shark, setting the oil from the whale carcass alight and angering it, but otherwise has no effect. The shark then ferociously attacks the buoy, ripping out the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy straps herself to the last remaining chain and as it is ripped from the buoy, she is pulled down to the ocean floor, pursued by the shark. At the last moment, she pulls out of the dive, and the shark impales itself on rebar protruding from the buoy's anchor.

Later, a boy named Miguel (from the opening of the film at the beach) finds the GoPro and informs his father, who is revealed to be Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy floating close to shore and revives her. She briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As she looks around the beach, she sees that Steven Seagull has made it to the shore. One year later, a healed Nancy (now graduated as an official doctor) and her sister Chloe go surfing in Galveston, Texas, as their father tells Nancy that her mother would have been very proud of her for not giving up.

Kaylie has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror. Using her position as an employee of an auction house, she obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras and a ""kill switch"" — an anchor weighted to the ceiling. Kaylie intends to destroy the mirror, but first wants to document its powers, proving Tim's innocence.

Over time back in 2002, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and their family dog Mason disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.

One night, Alan unchains Marie and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. The children try to destroy the mirror but it tricks them, making them believe they are hitting the mirror when they are actually hitting the wall. Alan also experiences a moment of lucidity and kills himself by forcing Tim to pull the trigger of the gun and shoot him, causing a small crack in the corner of the mirror in the process. Before dying, he begs the children to run, but Marisol and other victims of the mirror appear as horrific ghosts. The police arrive and take Tim into custody. Before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. As Tim is taken away and put behind bars, he sees the ghosts of his parents watching him from the house.

Back in 2013, Tim attempts to convince Kaylie that she's wrong and the siblings argue. When they notice the houseplants begin to wilt, they review the camera footage and see themselves performing actions they have no memory of. Tim finally accepts the mirror's supernatural power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be drawn back by the mirror's influence. Seeing a hallucination of her mother, Kaylie stabs it in the neck, only to realize that she has stabbed Michael Dumont, her fiancé who has come to check on her. They try to call the police, but are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children.

At this point, they see their doppelgangers inside the house standing in front of the mirror. Realizing that the 9-1-1 call is not going through, they go back inside the house. Kaylie and Tim begin hallucinating by seeing younger versions of each other. They get separated and each of them relives the nightmare from their youth. Tim awakens alone in the room with the mirror, while simultaneously a younger Kaylie hallucinates her mother beckoning her from the mirror.

Tim activates the kill switch, realizing too late and unable to see that Kaylie stood in its path, and he has killed her. The police arrive and arrest Tim, who is hysterical, just as they did when he was younger. As both a boy and an adult, Tim claims the mirror is responsible. As he is taken away and put behind bars, Tim's adult incarnation sees Kaylie's ghost standing in the house with his parents.

",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood
1. **Motherhood**: The theme of motherhood is present as Marie, the mother, becomes psychotic and attempts to kill her children due to the mirror's influence, highlighting a perversion of maternal care and protection.
2. **Other**: Another key theme is the **horrors of familial relationships** and the degradation of a family unit due to supernatural forces, represented by the decaying sanity of both parents.

### Role of Main Protagonist
1. **Other**: Kaylie's role doesn't fit neatly into the traditional categories. While she is neither an adolescent girl nor a mother or housewife, she is a **determined sibling** seeking to uncover the truth behind the traumatic events and bring justice to her family by proving the mirror's supernatural influence.

### Monstrous Feminine
1. **Monstrous Feminine**: Marie, the mother, can be perceived as the monstrous feminine in her role as a ""possessed body."" Her transformation into a psychotic figure who attacks her own children after being influenced by the mirror aligns with Barbara Creed's concept of the ""monstrous mother.""

### Protagonist's Fate
1. **Dies**: Kaylie dies at the end of the movie due to an unfortunate accident caused by the mirror's sinister influence.

### Female Victimization vs. Empowerment
1. **Victimization**: The story focuses more on **female victimization**.

Diabolique,1955,Henri-Georges Clouzot,M,Véra Clouzot,F,"The cruel and abusive headmaster of a boarding school, Michel Delassalle, is murdered by an unlikely duo -- his meek wife and the mistress he brazenly flaunts. The women become increasingly unhinged by a series of odd occurrences after Delassalle's corpse mysteriously disappears.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Diaboliques_(film),"A second-rate boarding school in Saint-Cloud, Hauts-de-Seine, in the Paris metropolitan area,[6] is run by the tyrannical and cruel Michel Delassalle. The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina, an émigrée from Venezuela. Michel also has an extramarital relationship with Nicole Horner, another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel. He is cruel to the students, beats Nicole, and mocks Christina about her heart condition.

Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in Niort, a town several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and, driving back to the school, dump his body in the neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the top, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Afterwards, the suit that Michel had been wearing when they drowned him is returned from the dry cleaners. When the proprietor of the dry cleaners also returns a key to a room in a nearby hotel that was with the clothes, Christina goes to the room. There, the cleaning man tells her that Michel had kept the room for awhile but was rarely if ever seen and stored nothing there.

Nicole sees in the newspaper that the police have found the corpse in the Seine. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she finds it is not actually Michel's body. There, she meets Alfred Fichet, a retired senior policeman now working as a private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin.

Christina, Nicole and other teachers find a student who claims that Michel has ordered him to rake leaves as punishment for breaking a window. Accusing him of lying, Christina confiscates his slingshot. Under the stress, Christina's heart condition worsens, and her doctors fear she may die soon unless she maintains strict bed rest. When the school photograph is taken, the result seems to show Michel's spectral figure in the window behind the students. Unnerved, Nicole leaves the school; she asks Christina to accompany her, but she is too ill and afraid.

Christina, overcome by fear, confesses everything to Alfred. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. That night, Christina hears noises and wanders around the school. When she realizes that someone is following her, she runs back to her room. There, she finds Michel's corpse submerged in the bathtub, which is filled with water. Michel rises from the tub, and Christina suffers a fatal heart attack. Michel and Nicole have set up Christina from the beginning, with Michel acting as a vengeful ghost to scare Christina to death. However, Alfred hears their celebration and figures out everything, telling them they will be sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison, depending on the judge.

The school is closed in the wake of the scandal. As the children and teachers leave, the same boy who had earlier broken a window breaks another. When asked how he recovered his slingshot, the boy says that Christina gave it to him.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Gender-based violence**: The plot highlights Michel's physical and emotional abuse of both Christina and Nicole, which leads them to conspire against him.

### Protagonist's Role:
1. **Other**: Christina's role doesn't fit neatly into the categories provided. She is neither an adolescent, a mother or housewife, nor does she hold a professional role related to beauty or caretaking. Instead, her role is that of a victim of abuse who is manipulated and ultimately driven to her death.

### Monstrous Feminine:
1. **Monstrous feminine**: Christina can be seen as embodying the ""possessed body"" or the ""monstrous mother"" archetypes to some extent. Her body and health are manipulated to create terror, and her demise is engineered through staged supernatural events.

1. **Dies**: Christina suffers a fatal heart attack due to the terror inflicted upon her by Michel and Nicole.

### Focus on Victimization or Empowerment:
1. **Victimization**: The narrative primarily concerns Christina's victimization and ultimate demise.

The plotting and cruel manipulation by Michel and Nicole ultimately lead to her death, highlighting her victimization rather than empowerment.",2,5,1,1,1,1
Cam,2018,Daniel Goldhaber,M,Madeline Brewer,F,A young camgirl discovers that she’s inexplicably been replaced on her site with an exact replica of herself.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_(film),"Alice Ackerman works as a camgirl on a website called FreeGirlsLive under the name ""Lola_Lola"". She is obsessed with her rank on the site, hoping to become number one someday. Alice's mother believes she works in web development, and her younger brother Jordan has agreed to keep her secret but persuades Alice to tell their mother the truth someday. Alice has two loyal viewers, Barney and Arnold, whom she regularly engages in private video calls with. She learns that Barney will be in her area soon, and agrees to meet up for a date. Alice also recognizes Arnold in public and realizes he has moved to her state.

One morning, Alice finds that she cannot access her FGL account, but that the account is still active and streaming. She finds that the channel has been taken over by someone with her exact appearance and mannerisms. Alice contacts the site's customer service, believing that they are replaying old shows, but they assure her that this is impossible. When Alice messages the channel, the ""Lola"" onscreen responds and addresses her directly. Alice confides in her fellow camgirls about the situation, who agree that it is strange but swear they are not responsible for it.

Alice continues to try and access her FGL account, as well as create a new one, but all her attempts fail. At Jordan's birthday party, a fight breaks out between him and his friends after they happen across one of Alice's streams and ridicule her, which causes her mother to inadvertently find out the truth. A humiliated Alice panics and leaves.

That night, the fake Lola hosts a show in which she stages her own suicide by shooting herself in the mouth. Alice contacts the police, who are largely unhelpful and judgmental. When the fake Lola announces an upcoming joint show with fellow camgirl BabyGirl, Alice unsuccessfully attempts to get in contact with the latter.

When ""Lola"" goes live during Alice's date with Barney, he assaults her, accusing her of lying about her identity to scam him, but she manages to free herself. She later uses information provided by Barney to determine Baby's real name, which is Hannah Darin, and discovers that the real Hannah had passed away in a car crash six months prior. She searches for other camgirls that she assumes to be doppelgängers, and notices that each of them have Arnold as their top friend.

Alice seeks Arnold out at his motel and begs for his help. He offers to let her stay the night. Alice wakes up in the middle of the night to find Arnold in a private cam session with Lola. An enraged Alice demands answers; Arnold explains that he knows about the replicas, but insists that he is not behind them. Alice then talks to the fake Lola from Arnold's computer, who appears oblivious to the fact that they are identical. She angrily leaves, ignoring Arnold's pleas with her to stay.

Alice goes home and sets up her vanity mirror, camera, and television in a position that creates an illusion showing multiples of her. She joins a private cam session with the fake Lola (who once again doesn't recognize her) and suggests that they go live together. The fake Lola enthusiastically agrees and viewers chalk up the two Lolas to special effects. Alice challenges Lola to a game – they must imitate each other; whoever the viewers think does the best wins. If Alice wins, she gets to ask anything of Lola. Alice is declared the winner after breaking her own nose, and she demands Lola's account password. She then deletes Lola's account just as it reaches the number 1 rank.

Some time later, she prepares to start a live show under a new account, with her mother assisting. The film ends as she starts all over again with a new identity.

Triangle,2009,Christopher Smith,M,Melissa George,F,"When Jess sets sail on a yacht with a group of friends, she cannot shake the feeling that there is something wrong. Her suspicions are realised when the yacht hits a storm and the group is forced to board a passing ocean liner to get to safety, a ship Jess is convinced she’s been on before.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_(2009_British_film),"Jess prepares to take Tommy, her autistic son, on a boat trip with her friend Greg and hears the doorbell ring, but no one is there. Jess drives to a Florida harbor without Tommy, explaining that he is at his special needs school, and boards Greg's boat with his deckhand Victor, his married friends Sally and Downey, and Sally's friend Heather. At sea, a storm approaches, and while Greg radios the Coast Guard, he picks up a distress signal from a woman frantically pleading help. The woman says that someone is killing everyone but is cut off before she can provide her location. The storm capsizes the boat and Heather is swept away by the ocean. The others climb onto the overturned boat when the storm clears.

The survivors board an ocean liner as it passes. It appears to be deserted despite the fact that they saw the silhouette of a person on the bridge deliberately ignoring their cries for help, and there is fresh food in the dining room. Jess experiences a sense of déjà vu as they explore the ship. They find Jess's keys near a display case for Aeolus, the ship's namesake. Jess spots someone watching them and Victor gives chase. She and Greg find ""Go To Theater"" written in blood on a mirror, but Greg insists it's just the crew playing a prank. Jess returns to the dining room, where the food is now rotting. Victor, covered in blood, tries to kill Jess but she fights him off.

She hears gunfire and follows it to a theater, where Greg lies dead of a gunshot. Sally and Downey say that Greg told them Jess shot him. A masked shooter kills them and chases Jess; she disarms the shooter, who tells her ""You have to kill them; it's the only way to get home"" before falling overboard.

She hears yelling and sees a second set of Jess and the others arrive on Greg's capsized boat and spot her as the earlier unseen figure. The second set of people board the boat. Jess is spotted when she drops her keys near the display case, and she attempts to warn Victor 2 when he chases her, only to accidentally impale his head on a wall hook. She finds dozens of the shooter's outfits, several shotguns, her own locket, and a note saying to kill them all when they board, written in her own handwriting. She takes a shotgun, intending to ""change the pattern,"" but the shooter, a third Jess repeating the loop, kills Greg and Downey 2 before mortally wounding Sally 2.

The first Jess chases Sally 2, who sends the distress signal heard on Greg's boat. Jess catches up to her on a deck filled with dozens of Sally corpses, and Sally succumbs to her wound as, below them, the second Jess kills the shooter Jess. The overturned boat returns again with another copy of Jess and the others, and Jess realizes the loop restarts once everyone is killed. Desperate to stop the loop, Jess sets everything from the first loop into motion, and cloaks her face using a burlap bag as a makeshift mask. After she is disarmed during the fight on the front deck, she urges her counterpart to kill everyone, and the second Jess knocks the original overboard.

She awakens washed ashore and discovers that it is the same morning. She returns home and watches from outside her house as her original morning self yells abusively at Tommy out of anger toward his autism. Apparently vowing to herself to change, she distracts her counterpart with the doorbell, then kills her, puts the bagged body in the car trunk, and leaves with Tommy. A seagull hits their windshield and dies, but when she picks it up and disposes of it, she sees a pile of dead seagulls. Realizing that she is still trapped in the loop, Jess hurriedly drives away, but crashes into a truck. Tommy is killed on impact, and the double of Jess from the trunk is seen dead at the scene. In the aftermath, the real Jess stands watching the accident scene. A by-stander, viewing Tommy, utters the crucial words, ""Nothing can bring him back."" A taxi driver approaches, and Jess accepts a ride to the harbour. After promising to return, she joins the others on Greg's boat, starting the loop again, evidently hoping that, by doing so, she will bring back her son.

",,"### Movie: Triangle

#### Themes related to womanhood:

During an appointment, Kate attempts to seduce him, but Elliott rejects her advances, stating his unwillingness to jeopardize his happy marriage. Kate has planned to spend the day with her teenaged son Peter, an inventor, but he has to cancel as he has reached a critical point in his research, for his entry to the city's science fair. Thus, Kate goes alone to the Metropolitan Museum of Art where she unexpectedly flirts with a mysterious stranger. Kate and the stranger stalk each other through the museum until they finally wind up outside, where Kate joins him in a taxi. They go to his apartment and have sex.

Hours later, Kate awakens and decides to discreetly leave while the man, Warren Lockman, is asleep. Kate sits at his desk to leave him a note and finds a document indicating that Warren has contracted both syphilis and gonorrhea. Shocked, she leaves the apartment, but having hastily forgotten her wedding ring on the nightstand, she returns to retrieve it. The elevator doors open on the figure of a tall, blonde woman in dark sunglasses wielding a straight razor, who violently slashes Kate to death in the elevator. Upon discovering the body, Liz Blake, a high-priced call girl, notices the killer in the elevator's convex mirror, and subsequently becomes both the prime suspect and the killer's next target.

Dr. Elliott receives a bizarre message on his answering machine from ""Bobbi"", a transgender patient. Bobbi taunts the psychiatrist for ending their therapy sessions, apparently because Elliott refuses to sign the necessary papers for Bobbi to get sex reassignment surgery. Elliott tries to convince Dr. Levy, the patient's new doctor, that Bobbi is endangering herself and others.

Police Detective Marino doubts Liz's story, partly because of her profession, so Liz partners with a revenge-minded Peter to find the killer, using a series of his homemade listening devices and time-lapse cameras to track patients leaving Elliott's office. They catch Bobbi on camera, and soon a tall blonde in sunglasses starts stalking Liz, subsequently making several attempts on her life. Peter thwarts one of them in the New York City Subway by spraying Bobbi with homemade Mace.

The pair scheme to learn Bobbi's birth name by infiltrating Dr. Elliott's office. Liz baits the therapist by stripping to lingerie and flirting with him, distracting him long enough to briefly exit and look through his appointment book. Peter is watching through the window when a blonde pulls him away. When Liz returns, a razor-wielding blonde confronts her; the blonde outside shoots and wounds the blonde inside, knocking the wig off and revealing the razor-wielding blonde as Dr. Elliott/Bobbi. The blonde who shot Bobbi is actually a female police officer, revealing herself to be the blonde who has been trailing Liz.

Elliott is arrested and committed to a mental institution. Dr. Levy explains later to Liz that Elliott wanted to be a woman, but his male side would not allow him to proceed with the operation. Whenever a woman sexually aroused Elliott, Bobbi, representing the unstable, female side of the doctor's personality, became threatened to the point that she finally became murderous. When Dr. Levy realized this through his last conversation with Elliott, he called the police, who went to work and eventually apprehended Elliott.

In a final sequence, Elliott escapes from the asylum after strangling a nurse, stalks Liz to Peter's house, and slashes her throat. She wakes up screaming and Peter rushes to her side, letting her realize it was just a nightmare.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

",,"**Movie Title: The Boy**

### Themes related to womanhood:
1. **Gender-based violence**: The movie heavily features the theme of abusive relationships. Greta's past involves an abusive ex-boyfriend who is trying to find her, and this element of the plot has a significant impact on her motivations and actions throughout the film.
2. **Caretaking and Nurturing**: While not directly listed, a prominent theme is the caretaking role Greta assumes, which can be tied to traditional gender roles. She is hired as a nanny and begins to take care of the doll Brahms with a sense of responsibility often associated with motherhood or caregiving.

### Role of the main protagonist:
1. **Caretaker/Nanny**: Greta's primary role in the story is that of a nanny, which fits into the category of professional roles related to caretaking. Although she is not a mother, her role involves nurturing and protecting a figure presented as child-like.

### Main protagonist as a monster:
2. **Other**: Greta is not portrayed as a monster in the story. She is the victim of the situations around her and works to survive and protect herself and Malcolm from the true antagonist, Brahms.

### Protagonist's fate:
2. **Survives**: Greta survives at the end of the movie. She manages to escape the house with Malcolm.

### Female victimization or empowerment:
2. **Empowerment**: The story leans more towards female empowerment. Greta starts off as a victim of her circumstances but gains agency throughout the movie.

She takes actions to ensure her own and Malcolm's survival, rather than just passively enduring her situation.",2,4,2,2,2,1
The Orphanage,2007,J. A. Bayona,M,Belén Rueda,F,"A woman brings her family back to her childhood home, which used to be an orphanage, intent on reopening it. Before long, her son starts to communicate with a new invisible friend.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orphanage_(2007_film),"In Spain, a young girl named Laura García Rodríguez is adopted from an orphanage. 30 years later, adult Laura returns to the closed orphanage, accompanied by her husband, Carlos Sánchez Rivera, and their seven-year-old son, Simón. She plans to reopen the orphanage as a facility for disabled children. Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, and draws pictures of him as a child wearing a sack mask. Social worker Benigna Escobedo visits the house to inquire after Simón, and it is revealed that Laura and Carlos adopted Simón and that he is HIV positive. Incensed at Benigna's intrusion, Laura asks her to leave. Later that night, Laura finds Benigna in the orphanage's coal shed, but Benigna flees the scene. Later, Simón teaches Laura a game which grants its winner a wish. Clues lead the two to Simón's adoption file. Simón becomes angry, and says that his new friend told him that Laura is not his biological mother and that he is going to die soon.

During a party for the orphanage's opening, Laura and Simón argue, and Simón hides from her after she slaps him across the face in a fit of frustration, which she immediately regrets. While looking for him, she encounters a child wearing a sack mask who shoves her into a bathroom and locks her inside. When Laura escapes, she realizes that Simón is missing and is unable to find him. That night, Laura hears several loud crashes within the walls of the orphanage. Police psychologist Pilar suggests to Laura and Carlos that Benigna may have abducted Simón.

Six months later, Simón is still missing. While searching for him, Laura spots Benigna, (pushing a doll in a pram) who is then struck and killed by an ambulance. The police find evidence that Benigna worked at the orphanage, and that she had a son named Tomás, who also lived there but was kept hidden due to his facial deformity (with Laura seeing old footage of Tomás being made to remove his mask, presenting his face to the camera). A few weeks after Laura was adopted, the orphans stole the mask that Tomás wore to conceal his deformed face and damaged eye. Embarrassed, Tomás refused to leave his hiding place in a nearby sea cave, and the rising tide drowned him.

Laura asks for the assistance of a medium named Aurora in the search for Simón. Aurora conducts a seance during which she claims to see the ghosts of the orphans crying for help. Laura discovers the remains of the orphans she grew up with in the orphanage. Benigna poisoned their meals and killed them for having caused Tomás's death and hid their remains in the orphanage's coal shed.[5] Unable to cope with the situation, Carlos leaves the orphanage.

Laura makes the orphanage look as it did thirty years ago and attempts to contact the children's spirits by playing one of their old games. The spirits lead her to the door of a hidden underground room. Inside is Simón's corpse, wearing Tomás' mask. Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking the entrance to the secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and fatally broke his neck (when he was knocked back by something ramming the secret door while he was standing by it).

Laura appears to take an overdose of sleeping pills. Then, apparently dying, she begs to be with Simón again and the children's spirits appear, (including an unmasked Tomás finally coming in to join the rest, no longer shy over his looks) with Simón among them. Simón tells Laura that his wish was for her to stay and take care of the orphans, she then happily tells them a story (as Tomás makes the others sit down next to him to listen). Sometime later, Carlos visits a memorial to Laura, Simón and the orphans. Carlos returns to the orphans' old bedroom and finds a medallion that he had given to Laura. He turns to look as the door opens, and he smiles.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

Mama,2013,Andy Muschietti,M,Jessica Chastain,F,"Guillermo del Toro presents Mama, a supernatural thriller that tells the haunting tale of two little girls who disappeared into the woods the day that their parents were killed. When they are rescued years later and begin a new life, they find that someone or something still wants to come tuck them in at night.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mama_(2013_film),"Distraught after losing his fortune in the 2008 financial crisis, stockbroker Jeffrey Desange murders his colleagues and his estranged wife before taking his young daughters, 3-year-old Victoria and 1-year-old Lily, away. Driving dangerously fast on a snowy road, Jeffrey gets into a car crash, breaking Victoria's glasses. Surviving the collision, he takes the children to an abandoned cabin. Planning to kill his daughters and then himself, he prepares to shoot Victoria but is killed by a shadowy figure.

Five years later, a rescue party, sponsored by Jeffrey's identical twin brother Lucas, finds a now 8-year-old Victoria and 6-year-old Lily in the cabin, alive but in a feral state after years of isolation. The girls are put in a welfare clinic under Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss. They refer to ""Mama,"" a mysterious maternal protector figure. The girls are initially hostile to Lucas but Victoria recognizes him after he gives her a pair of glasses and she can see properly. Victoria acclimates quickly to domestic life while Lily retains much of her feral behavior.

Lucas is attacked by a mysterious entity and put into a coma, leaving Lucas's girlfriend Annabel to care for the girls alone. She makes progress with Victoria but Lily remains hostile. Alarmed by nightmares of a strange woman and Victoria's warning about Mama, Annabel asks Dreyfuss to investigate. Dreyfuss’s research brings to light the story of Edith Brennan, a mentally ill asylum patient who died in the 1800s; he recovers a box from a government warehouse containing a baby's remains.

Annabel has a dream revealing Edith's past; when Edith was sent to the asylum, her child was given to nuns. She escaped and took her baby back, stabbing a nun. Fleeing her pursuers, she jumped off a cliff, but before hitting the water below, she and the child made an impact with a large branch. Edith drowned, but the child's corpse snagged on the branch and did not fall with her. Annabel realizes that Edith hadn't realized her child was caught on the tree and doesn't understand why her baby wasn't in the water with her. Edith's troubled ghost, Mama, searched the woods for her child for years until she discovered Victoria and Lily and took them as surrogates.

Lucas regains consciousness after a vision of his dead twin tells him to save his daughters. Victoria's growing closeness to Annabel makes her less willing to play with Mama, unlike Lily. Dreyfuss visits the cabin and is killed by Mama, who then attacks Annabel and the girls. She also kills their maternal great-aunt Jean and uses her body to spirit the children away. Annabel and Lucas find the children on the same cliff where Mama leaped with her infant.

Annabel, who found Dreyfuss' box of the child's remains, offers them to Mama. Mama recognizes her lost baby and her appearance briefly turns human. However, Lily calls out for Mama, causing her to revert to her monstrous form and attempt to take the girls. Victoria asks to stay with Annabel instead of leaving with Mama. Mama accepts and she and Lily plummet off the cliff. Mama and Lily are briefly shown as spirits happy to be united before hitting the branch and turning into a shower of moths. Annabel and Lucas embrace Victoria, who notices a moth landing on her hand, suggesting that Lily is still with her in spirit.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Motherhood (such as pregnancy or childbirth):** The theme of motherhood is central to ""Mama."" The ghostly figure ""Mama"" embodies a maternal instinct gone awry, desperately seeking to be reunited with her lost child and subsequently taking Victoria and Lily as surrogates.
2. **Gender-based violence (such as sexual or physical assault or abuse):** While not a primary theme, the movie incorporates elements of violence against women, considering Mama's backstory involving her brutal treatment and desperate actions to protect her child.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
1. **Other:** Annabel does not fit into traditional female roles such as mother or housewife, adolescent girl, caretaker, or professional related to beauty/perfection. She is Lucas’s girlfriend and is initially reluctant to take on a caregiving role, making her more of an unconventional female protagonist who grows into a protective figure through the narrative.

### Monstruous Feminine:
1. **Monstrous feminine:** The character Mama represents the monstrous feminine, specifically as a ""monstrous mother"" and a ""possessed body."" Her distorted maternal instincts drive the horror elements of the story.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive?
1. **Survives:** Annabel survives the movie. Although she faces numerous supernatural and physical threats, she manages to protect Victoria and fulfill a maternal role.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment:
1. **Empowerment:** The story leans more towards female empowerment. Annabel starts as a reluctant caregiver but evolves into a protective figure who fights for Victoria and confronts the monstrous Mama. Although she is subjected to threats, she gains agency and takes control of the situation by the end of the movie.",1,5,2,2,2,1
Revenge,2017,Coralie Fargeat,F,Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz,F,Jen's romantic getaway with her wealthy (married) boyfriend is disrupted when his friends arrive for an impromptu hunting trip. Tension mounts at the house until the situation culminates in an unexpected way.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_(2017_film),"Jen and Richard take a chartered helicopter to his secluded, luxury vacation home in the desert. Jen is a young, beautiful American who wants to move to Los Angeles to be someone. She seduces him, and afterwards, he calls his wife to check in. The next morning, Richard's friends Stan and Dimitri arrive early for their hunting vacation with Richard. Richard is forced to introduce Jen to them, as he was planning on her leaving before they arrived. That night, the four of them party, and Jen dances a sexy routine. When Richard declines to dance with her, she has fun doing a seductive dance with Stan.

Jen awakes to Richard being away for the morning and Stan becoming more and more aggressive with his advances. When she refuses, he rapes her. Dimitri is invited to join, but he refuses and ignores the rape. Richard returns, berates Stan, and offers Jen money to go live in Canada. Jen demands to go home, and when he resists, she threatens to reveal their relationship to Richard's wife if he does not call her the helicopter immediately. Richard slaps Jen, and she runs off into the desert, pursued by the three men. Cornering Jen at a cliff, Richard pushes her off, and she is impaled on a dead tree branch. The trio returns to the house, planning to retrieve her body after getting ready for their day of hunting.

Jen regains consciousness, and while bleeding, she is able to painfully free herself, but with a piece of the tree branch still stuck through her torso. When the men return, she hides. Night falls, and they track her bloody trail to a river, where they split up. Jen catches Dimitri alone, but he gets the upper hand, and while he is drowning her, she grabs his hunting knife and stabs him in the eye. He dies in the river. She takes his weapon and supplies, and hides in a cave. She remembers she has Richard's peyote and takes it all. She then painlessly uses the knife to cut out the tree branch and heats a beer can in the fire to cauterize the wound. The artwork on the can leaves a perfect scar/tattoo of a phoenix on her belly. After a series of nightmares of the men hunting her, Jen awakes and sets out with the gun.

Richard and Stan discover and dispose of Dimitri's body. They split up in separate vehicles to search the mountainside for Jen. Jen spots Stan first and ambushes him when he is refilling the SUV. After a grueling, bloody gunfight, Jen kills him and takes the SUV.

After not being able to contact Stan on the radio, an angry, exhausted Richard rides his motorcycle back to the house and calls the helicopter for immediate pickup. In the shower, he hears a noise, and while naked, he searches for Jen with his rifle. Jen finds him first, and when he dives for cover, she shoots him in the stomach. The two chase each other around the house with shotguns as Richard's blood covers every floor and wall. Richard finally overpowers her, and while strangling her, she shoves her hand into his stomach wound. Jen recovers her shotgun and kills him. A bloodied but triumphant Jen walks out of the house as she hears the helicopter approach.

",,"### **Themes Related to Womanhood:**
1. Gender-based violence: The film prominently features the traumatic experience of rape, which Jen, the protagonist, undergoes. This assault and the subsequent actions of the men highlight the theme of violence against women.
2. Female empowerment: Jen’s journey from a victim of a brutal assault to a powerful survivor who takes control of her fate and exacts revenge on her attackers is a significant aspect of the film.

### **Role of the Main Protagonist:**
- **Other:** Jen does not fit into the traditional female roles of mother, housewife, adolescent girl, or professional roles related to beauty or caretaking. Instead, she is portrayed initially as a carefree young woman looking to have a good time but transforms into a fierce survivor. Her role in the movie transitions from a vulnerable position to one of power and retribution.

### **Monstrous Feminine:**
- **Monstrous feminine:** Jen's transformation, particularly after her impalement and subsequent self-surgery, embodies elements of the monstrous feminine, specifically the archetype of the ""monstrous mother"" or ""castrator."" She rises from a near-death state with a powerful new identity (symbolized by the phoenix scar/tattoo) and hunts her attackers, turning the tables on them in a relentless and brutal manner.

### **Protagonist's Fate:**
- **Survives:** Jen emerges as the survivor, having killed all of her attackers and walking out of the house triumphantly as the helicopter approaches.

### **Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:**
- **Empowerment:** The story transitions from Jen's initial victimization to her ultimate empowerment. While the early part of the film deals with her horrific assault and the subsequent attempt to silence her, the focus shifts to her gaining agency and autonomy. Through her resourcefulness, resilience, and acts of retribution, Jen takes control over her own story and emerges as a powerful and triumphant figure.",2,5,1,2,2,1
May,2002,Lucky McKee,M,Angela Bettis,F,"Psychological horror about a lonely young woman traumatized by a difficult childhood, and her increasingly desperate attempts to connect with the people around her.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_(film),"Veterinary assistant May Canady experienced a troubled childhood due to her lazy eye. Her only ""true friend"" is a glass-encased doll named Suzie, which her mother made and gifted May for her birthday with the adage ""If you can't find a friend, make one."" Her optometrist fixes May's lazy eye, first with glasses, then with contact lens.

May befriends local mechanic Adam and eventually begins dating him. She fixates on his hands, which she considers to be the most attractive part of him. May's lesbian colleague, Polly, also shows an interest in her. One day, May remarks that Polly has a beautiful neck. During their flirtation, Polly gives May a pet cat, Loopy.

May invites Adam to her apartment, where he shows her a film, titled Jack and Jill, that he made for university. The film displays two young lovers who go on a picnic and end up eating each other. May becomes aroused by the cannibalism in the film. While passionately kissing, she bites Adam's lip, drawing blood. Disturbed, Adam abruptly leaves. May shouts at Suzie and shoves her in the cupboard.

May later begins volunteering at a school for blind children, where she takes a liking to a sullen young girl named Petey, who makes her a clay ashtray with the name ""May"" pressed into it. Abandoned by Adam, May gives in to Polly's advances and starts a short affair. May overhears Adam saying that he is glad he could get rid of her. Devastated, she visits Polly, but finds her with another girl named Ambrosia. When even Loopy refuses to come near her, an enraged May throws Petey's ashtray at her, killing her and shattering the ashtray. She develops delusions that Suzie is talking to her.

May takes Suzie to school, introducing her to the blind children as her best friend. The children struggle to take Suzie out of the glass case, ultimately shattering the case and injuring themselves and May. May returns home devastated with the ruined doll. The following day, she meets a young punk, who asks her if she wants to get some candy with him, which she accepts. May admires the tattoo on his arm. At her house, he discovers Loopy's corpse and calls May a ""freak"". May breaks down and fatally stabs him in the head. After heavily contemplating her future actions, May claims she needs ""more parts"".

On Halloween night, May dresses in a homemade costume resembling Suzie. She adopts a normal personality, and goes to Polly's house, where she slits Polly's throat with a pair of surgical scalpels. When Ambrosia arrives, May stabs her in the temples. Next, she visits Adam and his new girlfriend at his house. May murders both of them with the scalpels. At home, she designs her ""new friend"", a life-sized patchwork doll made from the punk's arms, Polly's neck, Ambrosia's legs, Adam's hands, his girlfriend's ears, and Loopy's fur for the hair. Using the broken remnants of the ""MAY"" ashtray to form an anagram, she names the doll ""Amy"". She realizes that Amy has no eyes and cannot ""see"" her, so she gouges out her lazy eye. Crying in pain and bleeding, she places the eye on Amy's head and begs the doll to look at her. She collapses on the bed beside the doll, and caresses it. Her creation comes to life, and brushes her face affectionately with Adam's hands.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:
1. **Other**: The film could be interpreted to delve into themes of loneliness and the psychological effects of isolation. May's troubled childhood and her fixation on creating a ""perfect"" friend suggest a deep exploration of mental health issues rather than traditional themes related to womanhood.
2. **Beauty, perfection, or aging**: May’s obsession with Adam's hands, Polly's neck, and the physical attributes of others alludes to a distorted pursuit of beauty and perfection. This theme manifests in her patchwork creation of a ""perfect"" friend made from body parts of those she admires.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:
5. **Other**: May's role doesn't fit neatly into the traditional categories provided. She is a veterinary assistant, and her actions throughout the film—motivated by severe psychological distress—do not align with roles traditionally associated with femininity, vulnerability, or weakness.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?
1. **Monstrous feminine**: May embodies the concept of the monstrous feminine, specifically the ""castrator"" and ""possessed body."" Her creation of a friend from the body parts of her victims and her mental descent into delusion and violence challenges traditional patriarchal views of women as victims.

### Does the Female Protagonist Die or Survive at the End?
2. **Survives**: While May physically survives, she collapses in emotional and psychological agony next to her grotesque creation, which comes to life in her delusion.

### Does the Story Ultimately Focus on Female Victimization or Female Empowerment?
1. **Victimization**: The story largely centers on May's psychological breakdown, her victimization through loneliness, and her lack of agency as she succumbs to her delusions and violent tendencies. Despite moments where she appears to take control (e.g., murdering those who wronged her), these actions are driven by her instability rather than genuine empowerment. The focus is more on her immediate survival and mental disintegration rather than gaining true autonomy or agency.",4,5,1,1,2,1
AVP: Alien vs. Predator,2004,Paul W. S. Anderson,M,Sanaa Lathan,F,"When scientists discover something in the Arctic that appears to be a buried Pyramid, they send a research team out to investigate. Little do they know that they are about to step into a hunting ground where Aliens are grown as sport for the Predator race.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator_(film),"A Predator ship arrives on Earth and uses a heating device to melt a hole in Antarctic ice. Meanwhile, a satellite detects the heat bloom beneath Bouvetøya, an island about 1,000 mi (1,600 km) off the coast of Antarctica. Wealthy industrialist Charles Weyland discovers through thermal imaging that there is a pyramid buried 2,000 ft (610 m) beneath the ice. He assembles a team of experts to investigate, including archaeologists, linguists, mercenaries, and a mountaineering guide named Lex Woods. Terminally ill, Weyland desires to claim the discovery in his name.

When the team arrives at the abandoned whaling station, they find a newly made tunnel running directly from the ice’s surface toward the pyramid beneath. The team descends the tunnel and begins to explore the pyramid, soon finding evidence of an ancient civilization and what appears to be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons that all have ruptured rib cages.

Meanwhile, three Predators ⁠— Scar, Celtic, and Chopper ⁠— arrive and kill the remaining team members on the surface. They make their way down to the pyramid and arrive just as the team unwittingly activates the structure and is trapped within it. The Xenomorph Queen awakens from cryogenic stasis and begins to produce eggs. When the eggs hatch, several facehuggers attach themselves to humans trapped in the sacrificial chamber. Chestbursters emerge from the humans and quickly grow into adult Xenomorphs. The humans take possession of the Predator's blasters, and conflict erupts between the Predators, Xenomorphs, and humans. Celtic and Chopper are killed by a Xenomorph, and Weyland buys Lex and Italian archaeologist Sebastian De Rosa enough time to escape from Scar, giving his life in the process. The two witness Scar kill a facehugger and a Xenomorph before unmasking and marking himself with the acidic blood of the facehugger. After Lex and Sebastian leave, another facehugger attacks Scar.

Through translation of the pyramid's hieroglyphs, Lex and Sebastian learn that the Predators have been visiting Earth for millennia. They taught the early human civilization how to build pyramids and were worshipped as gods. Once a century, they visit Earth to take part in a rite of passage by which several humans sacrifice themselves as hosts for the Xenomorphs, creating the ""ultimate prey"" for the Predators to hunt. As a fail-safe, if overwhelmed, the Predators would activate a self-destruct device to eliminate the Xenomorphs. They deduce that the Predators lured them into the pyramid to use as a sacrifice.

Lex and Sebastian decide that the Predators must be allowed to succeed so that the Xenomorphs do not escape to the surface. Sebastian is captured by a Xenomorph, and Lex returns the blaster to Scar. They are attacked by a Xenomorph, and Lex manages to kill it. Impressed, Scar uses parts of a dead Xenomorph to fashion weapons for Lex, and the two form an alliance. Lex finds Sebastian, who has become the host of a Xenomorph. She mercy kills him, but the Xenomorph Queen is freed from her restraints and, along with the other Xenomorphs, begins pursuing Lex and Scar. Scar detaches and uses a bomb in his wrist module to destroy the pyramid and the remaining Xenomorphs and their eggs. Lex and Scar reach the surface, and Scar uses acidic Xenomorph blood to mark Lex with the Xenomorph hunter symbol. However, the Xenomorph Queen reappears and attacks. They defeat the Queen by hooking her chains to a water tank and pushing her over a cliff so that she sinks to the ocean floor under the tank's weight. Scar is fatally wounded.

A Predator spaceship appears, and its crew retrieves its fallen comrade. An elder Predator presents Lex with a spear as a gift as the spaceship departs. Lex walks over to a snowcat and leaves the area. On the Predator spaceship, Scar's body lies at rest when a Predalien chestburster erupts from his chest.

The Cloverfield Paradox,2018,Julius Onah,M,Gugu Mbatha-Raw,F,"Orbiting above a planet on the brink of war, scientists test a device to solve an energy crisis and end up face-to-face with a dark alternate reality.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cloverfield_Paradox,"In 2028,[5] Earth is suffering from a global energy crisis. The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard particle accelerator aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the ""Cloverfield Paradox"", opening portals to parallel universes allowing their horrors to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor ""Monk"" Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam.

After about two years of unsuccessful attempts to activate the Shepard, the crew achieves a seemingly stable beam, but it overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find that Earth has vanished from view, and the gyroscope that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew works on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including the discovery (and subsequent rescue) of an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall. Volkov's eyeballs begin moving of their own accord; he begins conversing with his own reflection in a mirror and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so, he convulses and dies, and the station's worm colony bursts out of him. Jensen tells Hamilton not to trust Schmidt, who Jensen claims to be a spy sent by the German government to keep the Shepard shut down.

On Earth, Michael has woken up to discover a wave of destruction ravaging the planet, witnessing the silhouette of a giant monster in the distance. On his way to offer assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After finding the hospital was destroyed, he takes her to the underground shelter of a friend and tends to her wounds.

Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. The crew finds the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize it is trying to write something, it instructs them to ""cut Volkov open."" Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They finally locate Earth and begin restoring their communications, but transmissions state the station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior. The crew determines the particle beam overload has activated the Cloverfield Paradox, which is the cause of the strange events, and also moved the station to a parallel universe in which Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer, Schmidt is a spy, and Hamilton (though still working on the mission) has remained on Earth, where her children are still alive. Believing the paradox can be reversed and they can return to their own universe if they reactivate the Shepard, the crew starts making repairs.

Tam is trapped in a chamber that floods with water and then explodes, freezing the water and Tam. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return to parallel Earth with Jensen in order to prevent the fire that killed her children.

In one photograph, a family that is not the Ulmans stands next to the Volvo that she and Megan saw at the house. Later, three corpses are shown in one of the rooms, implying that they were the family in the photographs and the true residents of the house.

Brianna escapes through the main exit while Rachel and Zoey traverse to the alternate route, but Ben falls into the quicksand.

Zoey and Rachel make their way out through a manhole back into the city. Overjoyed at first that they are outside, they quickly realize they are still in the game when they encounter a panicked Brianna. If they do not make it out of this room, acid rain is periodically sprayed on them. The group opens a taxi to escape into but once Zoey enters, the taxi locks Rachel and Brianna out. Zoey falls into the next room while Rachel and Brianna succumb to the rain and die.

The next room is a child's bedroom containing a diary from Sonya, revealing the rooms are based on a fun day out she had with her mother. Zoey discovers Sonya's mother is Amanda Harper, who survived her fall in her original escape room and was forced into designing escape rooms for Minos after they abducted her daughter. Amanda appears and begs Zoey to become the next puzzle-maker for Minos, warning that she has no choice. Ben is revealed to be trapped in a cage. When Zoey refuses Minos' demand, Ben's cage starts filling with water, but Zoey and Amanda work together to free him. They manage to break out, fleeing the facility. They report their findings to the police, who retrieve the bodies of Rachel, Brianna, Nathan, and Theo; the news about Minos goes public. An FBI agent assures Zoey that Minos will be tracked down.

Filled with confidence, Zoey decides to take a plane home with Ben. Onboard, she sees a woman who resembles her therapist, and then realizes she is in another escape room. The distorted voice of Minos' leader mocks Zoey and Ben for falling into their latest trap as the plane begins to fall and gas fills the cabin.

She is not a mother, housewife, or a professional in the related fields of beauty or caretaking, but her role leans more towards an adolescent girl dealing with complex issues and hardships.

### Is the Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster?

Her survival at the end is depicted more as her escaping victimization rather than fully attaining empowerment.",5,2,2,1,2,2
The Devil's Backbone,2001,Guillermo del Toro,M,Marisa Paredes,F,"Spain, 1939. In the last days of the Spanish Civil War, the young Carlos arrives at the Santa Lucía orphanage, where he will make friends and enemies as he follows the quiet footsteps of a mysterious presence eager for revenge.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Backbone,"Casares, a doctor, and his friend's wife Carmen operate a small orphanage in a remote part of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Helping the couple are Jacinto, the groundskeeper (and former orphan), and his fiancée Conchita, a teacher. Casares and Carmen support the Republican loyalists, hiding a large cache of gold being used to back the Republican treasury. The orphanage has been subject to attacks from Francisco Franco's troops, and an inert bomb sits in the courtyard.

One day, an orphan named Carlos (unaware his father has been killed) arrives with Ayala and Domínguez, two loyalists. Casares and Carmen take Carlos in and he soon strikes up a friendship with Jaime, the orphanage bully, as well as Galvez and Owl (with Carlos left devastated when he suddenly finds himself left behind at the orphanage). Carlos soon begins having visions of a mysterious entity and hears stories about a child named Santi who went missing on the day the bomb was dropped in the courtyard. On his first night at the orphanage, Carlos is dared by Jaime to sneak to the kitchen for water after curfew and Carlos counters by daring Jaime to go with him. The boys reach the kitchen but Jaime hurries out after filling his pitcher, leaving Carlos alone. Carlos hears a whisper telling him that ""many of you will die."" Frightened, Carlos rushes outside and is caught by Jacinto. The next morning, Casares asks who snuck out after curfew but Carlos claims he went alone. This, as well as Carlos saving Jaime from falling in a cistern, earns him Jaime's friendship.

Jacinto knows of the gold hidden at the orphanage and uses his affair with Carmen as an opportunity to take her keys and search for the treasure. That night, the boys hear strange noises and Carlos decides to investigate. He sneaks out and encounters a pale figure of a young boy with a bleeding wound on his head, which causes him to run back into the building. Later, Carlos finds a drawing of a ghostly figure labeled ""Santi"", leading him to suspect that Jaime knows more than the other boys.

Casares sees that Ayala has been captured by the nationalists. Fearing Ayala will soon be tortured into revealing the gold’s location at the orphanage, he convinces Carmen that they must evacuate the children immediately. Jacinto overhears the conversation and confronts Carmen, demanding the stash of gold and crassly bringing up their affair in front of Casares. Enraged, Casares points a gun at Jacinto and forces him to leave.

As the orphans and faculty prepare to leave, Conchita discovers Jacinto pouring gasoline around the kitchen. She shoots him in the arm after he mocks her, causing a furious Jacinto to start a fire before fleeing the building. Carmen and fellow teacher Alma attempt to put out the fire but fail to prevent an explosion; Alma is killed by the blast along with several of the children (Owl is injured by shrapnel). Casares finds a mortally wounded Carmen inside the building and tearfully stays with her as she dies. He decides to remain in the charred orphanage with the surviving children, arming himself for Jacinto's return.

The following night, Jaime reveals to Carlos the details of Santi's disappearance: Jaime and Santi had been collecting slugs at the cistern when they spotted Jacinto attempting to open the safe where the gold was kept. Jaime managed to escape, but Jacinto cornered Santi and attempted to threaten him into keeping silent. In anger, Jacinto shoved Santi against a stone wall, giving him a severe head injury and sending him into shock. A panicked Jacinto then tied stones to Santi before sinking his body in the cistern. A terrified Jaime ran into the courtyard, only to have the bomb land several feet from him moments later.

Jaime insists that he is no longer scared of Jacinto and will kill him if he returns. Conchita attempts to walk to the nearest town for help when she encounters Jacinto and two associates driving back to the orphanage to claim the gold. Jacinto threatens her with a knife, telling her to apologize for shooting him, but she insults him and he stabs her to death.

Carlos has a final encounter with Santi's ghost, who he is no longer afraid of after hearing the circumstances of his death. The ghost quietly demands that Carlos bring Jacinto to him.

Casares dies of his injuries as Jacinto and his associates reach the orphanage and imprison the orphans while they search for the gold. The two other men eventually grow impatient and leave, but Jacinto finds and takes the stash. Jaime reveals Santi was murdered by Jacinto, encouraging the children to fight back and they fashion weapons from sharpened sticks and broken glass (as Galvez injures himself in a fall). The ghost of Casares then comes to free them from the locked door, leaving behind a monogrammed handkerchief. The children attack Jacinto in the cellar, finally pushing him into the cistern where he had dumped Santi's body. Weighed down by the gold he was carrying, Jacinto struggles to resurface but Santi's ghost appears from the depths and drags him to his death.

As Jamie impatiently forces Carlos to get going after finding him tearfully saying goodbye to Casares, the remaining children (including a limping Galvez and a carried Owl) leave the orphanage and head to town (looking back Carlos last to leave), Casares' ghost watches them from the doorway.

   - Carmen and Conchita both fit this category as they take on roles related to caretaking and education at the orphanage. Carmen runs the orphanage, helping support and protect the children, and Conchita works as a teacher.

### Main Protagonist Portrayed as a Monster:

Rather, their roles further underscore the women's vulnerability and victimization within the context of war and male aggression.",2,4,2,1,1,1

Has Jason finally met his match?",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th:_The_Final_Chapter,"After the events of the previous film, police clean up the grounds and Jason Voorhees' body, believed to be dead, is taken to the morgue. Jason spontaneously revives and escapes from the cold storage at the hospital, murdering the coroner Axel Burns with a hacksaw and gutting Nurse Robbie Morgan with a scalpel. The following day, a group of teenagers drives to Crystal Lake for the weekend. The group comprises Paul, his girlfriend Sam, virgin Sara, her boyfriend Doug, awkward Jimmy, and jokester Ted. On the way, the group comes across Pamela Voorhees' tombstone and a hitchhiker, who Jason soon kills.

The teens arrive and meet neighbors Trish Jarvis, her twelve-year-old brother Tommy, and the family dog Gordon. While going for a walk the next day, the teens meet twin sisters Tina and Terri and go skinny dipping with them. Trish and Tommy happen upon the scene, and Trish is invited to a party taking place that night. Afterward, when their car breaks down, Trish and Tommy are helped out by a young man named Rob Dier. They take him to their house, where he meets their mother. Tommy shows him several monster masks he made before Rob leaves to go camping.

Later that night, the teens begin the party. A jealous Sam sees Tina flirting with Paul and leaves. She goes out to the lake, where Jason impales her from under a raft. When Paul goes out to look for her, he is harpooned in the groin. Terri tries to leave the party early, but Jason stabs her with a spear before she can get on her bike. Mrs. Jarvis arrives home and discovers the power is out. While searching for her children and Gordon, she is killed offscreen. Trish and Tommy soon arrive and realize their mother is missing. Trish goes to search for her and finds Rob's campsite. It is revealed that Rob is the brother of Sandra Dier.[N 1] Rob further explains to her that Jason is still alive and that he came to Crystal Lake to avenge his sister's death. Worried about Tommy's safety, Trish and Rob return to the house.

After sleeping with Tina, Jimmy goes downstairs to get a bottle of wine. Jason pins his hand with a corkscrew before striking his face with a meat cleaver. Tina looks out a window upstairs and finds that her sister's bike is still there. Jason then bursts through the window and throws her to her death, crashing into the car. While a stoned Ted watches stag films with a film projector, he gets too close to the projector screen and is stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife from the other side. Jason then goes upstairs, where Doug and Sara finish making love in the shower. After Sara leaves, Jason kills Doug by crushing his head against the shower tile. When Sara screams upon finding Doug's body, she tries to escape but gets a double-bit axe through her chest.

Trish, Rob, and Gordon go next door to investigate and discover the teens' bodies. Gordon flees, and Jason kills Rob in the basement as Trish runs home, taking Rob's machete. She and Tommy barricade the house, but Jason breaks in and chases them into Tommy's room. Trish lures Jason out of the house, escapes, then returns home and is devastated to learn that Tommy did not run away. She senses Jason behind her and tries to fight him off with the machete but is overpowered. Having disguised himself to look like Jason as a child, Tommy distracts him long enough for Trish to hit him with the machete, but she merely whacks off his mask. As Trish stands horrified at Jason's deformed face, Tommy takes the machete and strikes it in the side of his skull, causing him to collapse to the floor and split his head upon impact. When Tommy notices that Jason's fingers are slightly moving, he continues to hack at his body, yelling, ""Die! Die! Die!"" while Trish repeatedly yells out his name.

Elise reluctantly agrees to try to contact the spirit of Quinn's mother, Lily, who died one year prior. However, Elise urges Quinn not to try to contact her mother again after sensing a malevolent force.

Grace, an elderly woman who lives at Quinn's apartment building and suffers from dementia, says several strange and cryptic things to Quinn, seeming to allude to an unseen spirit.

Distracted, she is hit by a car, breaking both of her legs.

Now stuck in her home with her father, Sean, and brother, Alex, Quinn begins to experience increasingly disturbing paranormal phenomena, including seeing visions of a dark spirit wearing an oxygen mask known as the Man Who Can't Breathe. Quinn realizes that he is the same figure that caused her accident. Sean runs into Grace's husband, Harry, and learns that Grace has passed away.

Sean meets with Elise, who like him is also grieving after the death of her husband, Jack, and tries to convince her to help his daughter. Elise declines, stating that her previous visits to the dark spiritual world of the Further made her realize that an evil spirit―a Bride in Black―is hunting her. However, she is convinced by her friend and former colleague, Carl, to continue using her spiritual ability after he reminds her about her successful case involving Josh Lambert in 1986 and that she is stronger than the spirits, because she is still alive.

Due to Elise's initial refusal, Alex suggests Sean call on alleged demonologists, Specs and Tucker, who have built a following on the internet. During their investigation, Quinn becomes briefly possessed by the Man Who Can't Breathe and attacks Sean, Specs, and Tucker. Sean realizes Specs and Tucker are frauds and prepares to kick the duo out until Elise arrives. Deducing that the dark spirit's goal is to lure potential victims to the Further, so it can eat their life force, Elise decides to enter the spiritual world and enlists Specs and Tucker to help.

Elise enters the Further and has a brief fight with the Bride in Black before she discovers Jack's spirit. Jack begins to encourage Elise to commit suicide, so that they might be reunited. Elise realizes that Jack is actually the Man Who Can't Breathe in disguise and orders it to release Quinn. Quinn appears. Elise and the Man Who Can't Breathe engage in a struggle over Quinn before Elise escapes the Further and realizes that Quinn has to defeat him on her own. Though Quinn is at first at a disadvantage, Elise receives a message from Grace's spirit: Lily had left Quinn a letter to read before she graduated high school, but Quinn never found it. Elise calls out to Lily's spirit to help. Lily suddenly appears in the Further and helps Quinn defeat the Man Who Can't Breathe by inspiring her to stand up for herself and pull off his mask, seemingly suffocating and destroying him. Quinn escapes the Further. Elise gives parting words to the family, including words of encouragement from Lily's spirit. She leaves with Specs and Tucker and the three agree to form a partnership.

The Taking of Deborah Logan,2014,Adam Robitel,M,Jill Larson,F,"What starts as a poignant medical documentary about Deborah Logan's descent into Alzheimer's disease and her daughter's struggles as caregiver degenerates into a maddening portrayal of dementia at its most frightening, as hair-raising events begin to plague the family and crew and an unspeakable malevolence threatens to tear the very fabric of sanity from them all.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taking_of_Deborah_Logan,"Mia Medina, Gavin, and Luis are a team of students who want to create a documentary about Deborah Logan, an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease living with her daughter, Sarah. As the film crew records her daily life, Deborah starts to exhibit increasingly bizarre actions that her personal physician states are normal for someone with an aggressive form of Alzheimer's. However, cameraman Luis begins to notice that her actions defy normal explanations and expresses concern that something supernatural is occurring. Things grow more tense after Luis and Gavin record audio of Deborah speaking in French, talking about sacrifices and snakes. They notice that the line for 337 at her switchboard continually rings; the line belonged to local physician Henri Desjardins, who disappeared after a series of cannibalistic ritualized murders of four young girls. Deborah's behavior becomes so extreme that she is hospitalized for her own safety. Dismayed, Gavin quits the film.

The others discover that Desjardins was supposedly trying to recreate an ancient Monacan ritual that would make him immortal but required the deaths of five girls that recently had their first period. They wonder whether Deborah is possessed by Desjardins. Sarah, Mia and Luis discover that Deborah had unsuccessfully tried to abduct Cara Minetti, a young cancer patient. At the hospital, Harris Sredl, Deborah's friend, visits her and she begs him to kill her. He tries to comply but is knocked out by the entity possessing her. Sarah learns from Harris that years ago, Deborah found out that Desjardins planned to use Sarah as his fifth victim. It had prompted her to murder the doctor before he could accomplish his plan, and she buried his body in the yard. The group finds the body's remains and tries to burn them, but fails when Desjardin's spirit intervenes.

Deborah succeeds in abducting Cara and taking her to the location where Desjardins had killed his previous victims. After discovering Deborah has gone into the mines, Sheriff Linda Tweed follows behind, only to be killed. Sarah and Mia find Deborah as she is trying to swallow Cara's head in a snake-like manner and manage to burn Desjardins' corpse. Sarah and the re-conscious Deborah reunite. The film then cuts to news footage of reporters stating that Deborah was deemed unfit to stand trial for her crimes and abduction of Cara, her health having deteriorated rapidly in the months following the incident. Cara has overcome her cancer and is celebrating her 10th birthday. As the reporter begins to wrap up the story, Cara turns to the camera and gives a sinister smile, implying that Desjardins is now possessing her.
",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

   - Deborah Logan survives at the end of the film, although she is deemed unfit to stand trial due to her deteriorated health.

### Female Victimization or Empowerment:

The Wolf House,2018,Cristóbal León,M,Amalia Kassai,F,"María, a girl from Colonia Dignidad, in Chile —a kind of sectarian community, tyrannically mastered by the ruthless Paul Schäfer, a German madman, religious fanatic and child predator, who would end up turning the place into a torture center at the service of the military dictatorship ruled by Augusto Pinochet—, is punished for having lost three pigs, so she decides to run away and take refuge in an abandoned house hidden in the forest.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_House,"María, an idle and irresponsible girl living in the isolated Colony, flees into the woods rather than face the community's punishment for failing to contribute. She narrowly escapes a pursuing wolf by taking refuge in an abandoned house.

She is welcomed by two pigs, the only inhabitants of the place. Like in a dream, the universe of the house reacts to Maria's feelings and shapes itself into her ideal home. The pigs transform slowly into humans whom she names Ana and Pedro. Although the wolf's presence outside makes it impossible for any of them to leave, the group lives happily for a short time. María ignores the wolf's repeated attempts to tempt her back to the Colony and denies its description of the house as a new kind of cage.

Time passes. As the secluded household begins to run out of food, Ana and Pedro become increasingly hostile and secretive toward María. They hide food from her and share it between themselves. María, afraid to confront them, instead tries to leave the house and pick apples in the woods. Ana and Pedro stop her. They claim there is enough food in the house and that leaving would only put her at risk of being caught by the wolf. For the first time, María thinks longingly of the Colony and voices a more positive view of the wolf. The wolf, she thinks, knows the way home. The wolf would take care of her.

Ana and Pedro tie María to a bed to prevent her from leaving. As they stand over her discussing their hunger, María realizes they intend to eat her. Despairing, María begs the wolf to save her. The wolf enters the house and eats Ana and Pedro. María transforms into a bird and flies home to the Colony.

In a brief closing narration, the wolf says María regained her helpful and hardworking spirit once she returned home. He offers to take the ""little pigs"" in the audience home to the Colony, where he promises he will care for them.",,"### Themes Related to Womanhood:

1. **Isolation and Captivity (Other)**: María's experience in the house serves as an allegory for the isolation and confinement often experienced by women in oppressive societies. It explores how women are manipulated and controlled, underscoring themes of freedom versus captivity.

2. **Mental Manipulation and Psychological Control (Other)**: The story examines psychological manipulation, as María is both tempted and terrorized by the wolf, which can be interpreted as a metaphor for an intrusive, controlling force in her life.

### Role of the Main Protagonist:

1. **Adolescent girl**: María is described as an ""idle and irresponsible girl,"" pointing towards her being a young, perhaps adolescent, character. This role reflects her vulnerability and the transitional phase of her life.

### Main Protagonist as a Monster:

1. **Other**: María is not portrayed as a monster in the conventional sense as described by Barbara Creed. Instead, she is more of a victim, manipulated and tormented by the wolf, and later on, by Ana and Pedro who transform into a predatory threat.

### Main Protagonist's Fate:

1. **Survives**: María transforms into a bird and flies back to the Colony, implying her survival at the end of the movie.

### Focus on Female Victimization or Empowerment:

1. **Victimization**: The story predominantly focuses on María's victimization. She is subjected to psychological and physical threats throughout the movie's runtime and seems to lack agency. Even her ultimate return to the Colony can be seen as her reverting back to a controlled, yet 'safe', environment rather than truly gaining autonomy and empowerment.

Overall, ""The Wolf House"" delves into themes of psychological control and isolation, depicting María as a victim who lacks significant agency, ultimately highlighting her victimization rather than empowerment.",2,2,2,1,2,1
